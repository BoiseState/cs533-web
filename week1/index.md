# Week 1 — Questions ({date}`wk1 range`)

:::{updated} F21
:::

The key learning outcomes for this week are:

- Ask and refine questions that can be answered with data
- Install and run the software required for the course
- Write and run basic Python code in a Jupyter notebook
- Begin to think about the complexity of meaningful questions

This week draws from chapters 1–4 from {book}`p4da` and chapters 1-2 of {book}`tlds`.
If you already know Python, the Python parts should mostly be review.

## {{mvideo}} Asking Questions

In this video, I introduce *questions* in their broader context of using data to advance goals. 
I also introduce the idea of **operationalization**, which will be a key concept throughout the class.

## {{mvideo}} Questioning Questions

We make our {term}`operationalizations <Operationalization>` better by questioning them.  What do they capture?  Who or what do they prioritize?

:::{note}
In this video, I talk about asking what it takes to *improve* a metric.  It would be more
precise to ask what would *change* a metric; whether increasing or decreasing a metric is
an improvement depends on the metric and application context.  The metric itself does not
improve or get worse without that context.

When I re-record this video for a future revision, I'll change my language.

## {{mbook}} Textbook Chapters - Questions

The first videos of this class go with chapters 1 and 2 of {book}`tlds`.

## {{mclass}} Tuesday Class

On Tuesday, we will:

- Introduce the class
- Start working on defining and clarifying questions
- Set expectations for the week and semester

## {{mtask}} Pre-Class Inventory

Fill out the pre-class skill inventory and survey by **noon on Tuesday**.

## {{mtask}} Install Software

Make sure you have [installed the course software](../../resources/software.md) so you can complete the assignment.

## {{mquiz}} Week 1 Quiz

The Week 1 individual quiz (in {{LMS}}) is due at **8am Thursday**.
It is only over material prior to this point.

You will have **30 minutes** from when you start the quiz to complete it.
These quizzes are never going to be terribly long; this one is particularly designed to be pretty easy, as an
initial quick check and to give you experience with the quiz process.

:::{tip}
I recommend watching the remaining videos before class Thursday as well, but they will not
be tested over in the quiz.

## {{mvideo}} {{mnotebook}} Our First Python Notebook

This video shows you how to start Jupyter, create a notebook, and run Python code.
It also shows you how to prepare a notebook to submit as an assignment.

:::{note}
I have seen cases where the instructions to export to a PDF do not work correctly in Firefox; they result in a mangled
PDF file that does not correctly display charts.  If you encounter this problem, I have documented some fixes over in
the [common problems](prob-mangled-pdf) page.

## {{mclass}} Thursday class

In class on Thursday, we will:

- Meet our teams
- Take the Week 1 team quiz (over the same material as the individual quiz)
- Debug software installations
- Activity to dive deeper into defining problems and questions

## {{mbook}} Textbook Chapters - Python

The Python material we are working on this week is a subset of the material in chapters **1–4** of
the [textbook](../../resources/index.md#books). I don't expect to you get through all 3 chapters
thoroughly this week, and we will be introducing more Python features as we need them throughout the
semester. I will note specific chapters and sections relevant to videos in their _Resources_
subsections.

## {{mvideo}} Data Types and Control Flow

This video introduces fundamental Python data types and operations, along with variables and basic control flow.
