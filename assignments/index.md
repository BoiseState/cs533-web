## General Rubric

Assignment components are graded based on *levels of achievement*: how well did you achieve the requirements and learning outcomes for that piece of the assignment?
This is in contrast to models where points are deducted for specific types of errors; the grader looks at the assignment component as a whole and identifies the level of achievement it demonstrates.

Exemplary (95–100%)
:   Results are correct and clearly presented; charts are well-labeled and appropriate; explanatory text clearly and concisely tells the story with appropriate context and analysis; organization makes it easy to review.

Basically Correct (85–95%)
:    The analysis comes to correct (or defensible) results and conclusions, but the presentation is not easy to follow and/or portions are not clear or lack context or labels.

Right Idea (75–85%)
:    The approach is appropriate, but the work has mistakes in code, analysis, or presentation that undermine the correctness of conclusions.

Solid Start (60–75%)
:    The work makes a good start, but has fundamental conceptual problems in code, analysis, or presentation such that it will not produce legitimate results.

Did Something (<60%)
:    The solution began an attempt, but is either insufficiently complete to assess correctness or is on entirely the wrong track.

Precise numeric grades indicate how well you demonstrated that level of achievement; full achievement is at the top of the level's range.
For example, 92% is “mostly basically correct; a couple sub-components are more at the Right Idea level”.
