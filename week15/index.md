## {{mnotebook}} Time Series Example

The [MovieLens Time Series notebook](../resources/tutorials/MLTimeSeries.ipynb) demonstrates basic time series operations in Pandas.

## {{mvideo}} Correlated Errors

Regression models require that the data be *independent*. This video introduces two kinds of non-independence and methods for addressing them: grouped observations addressed with a mixed-effects model and temporal auto-correlation addressed with ARIMA models.
