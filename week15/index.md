## {{mquiz}} Makeup Exam

The makeup midterm due **{date}`wk15 sat long`** and operates on the same
schedule as the other midterms.  It covers the entire semester, with an emphasis
on material since the 2nd midterm. The rules and format are the same as for
[Midterm A](midterm-a).

I encourage you to come and take the exam, as it is the single best way to
prepare for the final.  You can at any time leave the exam, and take it with
you; I will only grade it if you turn it in, and there is no problem with
showing up, looking at it, even filling it out, and deciding you like your
current grades well enough to not turn it in.

:::{warning}
If you turn in the makeup exam to be graded, its grade will replace the lower of your Midterm A and B grades, **even if that lowers your final grade**.
Only turn it in if you think you did better than your worst normal midterm!

## {{mvideo}} Time Series Operations

Time is an important kind of data that we haven't spent much time with — this video discusses the fundamental Pandas operations for working with time-series data.

## {{mnotebook}} Time Series Example

The [MovieLens Time Series notebook](../resources/tutorials/MLTimeSeries.ipynb) demonstrates basic time series operations in Pandas.

## {{mvideo}} Correlated Errors

Regression models require that the data be *independent*. This video introduces two kinds of non-independence and methods for addressing them: grouped observations addressed with a mixed-effects model and temporal auto-correlation addressed with ARIMA models.

## {{mquiz}} No Quiz 15

Take **Quiz 15** in {{LMS}}.

## {{mdoc}} Farewell

It's been grand!

I would love to hear feedback on how to further improve the course; I have tried to make some corrections as a result of the midterm assessment process, and will be keeping those notes for next year, but further suggestions either in the course evaluations or by Piazza are welcome.

I hope to see many of you in future courses!

## {{massignment}} Assignment 7

[Assignment 7](../assignments/A7/index.md) is due **{date}`wk15 sun xlong`**.

## {{mquiz}} Final Exam

The final exam will be on {{LMS}}.  It will be available for 72 hours beginning on **{date}`wk16 mon xlong`**.

### Format

The exam follows the same format as the [midterms](midterm-a).

### Study Tips

- Review the previous quizzes, assignments, and midterms.
- Sit for the makeup midterm, even if you do not plan to turn it in.
- Review lecture slides to see where you are unclear on concepts and need to review.
- Skim assigned readings, particularly the section headings to remind yourself what was in them.
- Review the [course glossary](../glossary.md), keeping in mind that it does contain terms we haven't gotten to yet.
