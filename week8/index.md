# Week 8 â€” Regression ({date}`wk8 range`)

:::{updated} F22
:::

In this week, we are learning about linear regression with StatsModels.
All the examples will use the StatsModels OLS (ordinary least squares) model, generally with the
[formula interface](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/generated/statsmodels.formula.api.ols.html#statsmodels.formula.api.ols).

:::{admonition} Slide Clarification
:class: note

On slide 6, where I show the slope, intercept, and variance in a model, I have extended the plot to include 0 at the left end of the *x*-axis.
This is to highlight the meaning of the intercept. It is important to note that the intercept is where the line **crosses zero**, not where it crosses the left Y-axis.

Also, when discussing this slide, I am imprecise but make it sound like the unexplained variance is the remainder after *projecting* the data onto the line.
It is the variance remaining after *subtracting* the line.
A video in Week 9 provides more clarity on this relationship.
