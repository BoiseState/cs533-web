Science.

I generally respond to course questions during normal hours (9a–5p M–F).
I may occasionally reply to a question in an evening or on the weekend, but do not plan on it.
I strongly encourage you to reply to each others' questions in Piazza; I would prefer to endorse a student answer than write my own, as answering questions is a valuable tool for learning.
