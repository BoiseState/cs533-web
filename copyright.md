The materials for this course are an **open educational resource**.  Unless otherwise noted in a
specific page or resource, all content with the exception of the assignments is made available under
the terms of the [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License][BY-NC-SA].  This
means that you can reuse, adapt, and remix the content, so long as you (1) properly attribute the
original creator(s) and (2) extend the same permission to people obtaining your version.  For the
purposes of my interpretation of the license, or in excess of the grants given by the Creative Commons
license, you **are allowed** to use the materials at educational institutions that charge tuition;
I do not consider this prohibited commercial use.  Similarly, using these materials to study at
your company, or to train others, is also acceptable; I'd love to hear what you're doing.[^1]

[^1]: My primary purpose with the non-commercial license is to make it illegal
      for companies like CourseHero to sell my materials. I'm generally fine
      with other uses that respect the attribution and share-alike requirements.
      If you aren't sure if your intended use is ok, just drop me an e-mail for

You may freely use small snippets of my example code in work under any license; I would appreciate

## Assignments and Solutions

The assignments are not open-licensed.  Students in my class are authorized to use them for the
purpose of studying in the course and preparing their solutions to the assignments; I further grant
permission to retain copies of the assignments, student solutions, and my own solutions that I
provide through private class channels indefinitely, but **not** to redistribute those solutions.

The principles of academic integrity, and for Boise State University students, the Student Code of
Conduct ([Policy 2020](https://www.boisestate.edu/policy/student-affairs/code-of-conduct/)) prohibit
publishing solutions to the assignments, such as posting them to a web site or committing them to a
public GitHub repository.  To the extent that an assignment solution is a derived work of my
assignment description, such publication is also a violation of my copyright.  I encourage you to
use git and, if you like, GitHub for your course work; please just keep it in a private repository.

## Teaching with These Resources

If you are an instructor looking to adapt this material and would like access to the video source
materials (raw captures, Camtasia project files, and slide decks), please contact me.  I am also
interested in sharing and collaborating on the in-class exercises that are not a part of the public
course materials.

I'm also happy to grant permission to reuse my assignments in your course â€” contact me for details
and written permission.
