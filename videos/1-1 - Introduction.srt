00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,440
Hello and welcome to CS 533 : Introduction to Data Science.

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:08,039
This is the introduction video that's going to give you an overview of what it is going to we're

3
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:13,545
going to be talking about this semester and provide you with guidance for how to get started with the course.

4
00:00:13,545 --> 00:00:18,900
Our learning outcomes for this video are to introduce the class subject What is data science for

5
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:23,885
our purposes, for you to understand the learning outcomes of the course for you to understand

6
00:00:23,885 --> 00:00:30,005
how this class is structured at a high level we'll be supplementing this with a discussion in class.

7
00:00:30,005 --> 00:00:35,385
And then also to know where to get help throughout the semester as you're in the course.

8
00:00:35,385 --> 00:00:41,220
To get started though I want to talk about what data science is, and there are many different

9
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:44,975
people that are going to have many different definitions of data science.

10
00:00:44,975 --> 00:00:50,470
But the definition I've been using as I've built out this class is that data science is the use

11
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:56,870
of data to provide quantitative insights on questions of scientific business or social interest.

12
00:00:56,870 --> 00:01:00,530
There may be many different things to which we want to apply data science.

13
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:03,480
Maybe in a business context where we want to gain

14
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:07,010
understanding about the effectiveness of our business processes.

15
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:10,700
We may want to evaluate a change to some aspect of

16
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:14,485
how we carry out our business or how we manufacture or provide our products.

17
00:01:14,485 --> 00:01:19,425
We may want to understand the impacts of some of our business decisions.

18
00:01:19,425 --> 00:01:23,010
We may have a scientific question where we are trying to produce

19
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:26,740
generalizable knowledge to understand the world around us.

20
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:31,305
We may have social interests particularly if we are deploying data science in a nonprofit or a

21
00:01:31,305 --> 00:01:36,525
government agency or an educational setting where we're trying to understand social dynamics

22
00:01:36,525 --> 00:01:42,105
we're trying to understand the effectiveness and the impact of policies and programs and various

23
00:01:42,105 --> 00:01:47,665
other purposes to inform our social mission with quantitative insights To give you some more

24
00:01:47,665 --> 00:01:52,855
about how I go about thinking about this and some more of the background of how I've been

25
00:01:52,855 --> 00:01:56,615
designing the class, I find this quote from Sergio Sismondo's.

26
00:01:56,615 --> 00:02:00,115
introduction to science and technology studies useful.

27
00:02:00,115 --> 00:02:06,380
In that book, he says by itself some piece of data has no meaning.

28
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:11,795
Data is only given meaning as evidence by the people who make use of it.

29
00:02:11,795 --> 00:02:16,970
And this means that we can't just go find a bunch of data and oh we have the answer.

30
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:20,995
We have to do work. To get our data into a form

31
00:02:20,995 --> 00:02:25,385
where it can actually provide answers to the questions we care about.

32
00:02:25,385 --> 00:02:31,790
We need to do work to frame our questions in a way that we can actually answer them with the

33
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:34,985
data that we have available or that we can obtain.

34
00:02:34,985 --> 00:02:40,365
And this is a human process. And it's also a social process which is one of the reasons why

35
00:02:40,365 --> 00:02:46,870
we're going to be using our in-class time for discussion and application exercises The

36
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:53,290
data gains its meaning and becomes evidence for particular conclusions or particular answers

37
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:59,225
because we go through the process of interpretation and we go through the process of presenting

38
00:02:59,225 --> 00:03:04,380
our interpretations to others and discussing and debating how we came to the conclusions, the

39
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:08,070
conclusions we came to, the level of support they have from the data.

40
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:12,425
So we're going to be practicing that a lot in this class of going from

41
00:03:12,425 --> 00:03:16,970
data to evidentiary meaning as a human process.

42
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:20,550
In pursuit of all of this there are a number of learning outcomes for this course.

43
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:25,125
The first one is that I want you to be able to explore a data set.

44
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:29,150
Someone gives you some data and you first need to be able to get your bearings in it Understand

45
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:32,720
what data you have, be able to assess whether or not it would

46
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,570
answer particular questions and what questions you might be able to answer with it.

47
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:41,015
You need to be able to define a question that we can answer.

48
00:03:41,015 --> 00:03:47,505
This is not an easy process, we're going to be talking quite a bit more about it in the next two videos…But.

49
00:03:47,505 --> 00:03:52,065
Taking a goal that we have and turning it into a question that we can actually answer through a

50
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:56,980
data analysis is a process that takes work and we're going to be learning that I want you to be

51
00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:00,605
able to then actually carry out your analysis in a

52
00:04:00,605 --> 00:04:04,520
way that is documented so other people can understand what you did.

53
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:07,810
It's reproducible So others can do the same analysis.

54
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:13,830
And it also doesn't unnecessarily waste computing resources to come to the answers.

55
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:18,380
You make efficient use of the resources we have available to us. And also then we can scale to

56
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:24,220
doing analysis on very large data sets It's not enough to just do an analysis I want you to be

57
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:27,900
able to present the results of your analysis, both through

58
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:32,415
visuals - charts and graphics - and through written argument.

59
00:04:32,415 --> 00:04:38,760
To be able to communicate to other people your peers in the class, myself.

60
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:44,155
In the future your advisors your supervisors at work, what it is that you learned from the data

61
00:04:44,155 --> 00:04:49,910
and why your conclusions are a reliable and defensible interpretation of the data.

62
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:53,875
I want you to be able to identify weaknesses in data analysis.

63
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:59,260
No data analysis is perfect There are going to be weaknesses and downsides, and we'll have to

64
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:05,530
make trade-offs when we make decisions of how we analyze the data, but also not all weaknesses are created equal.

65
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:11,095
I want you to be able to assess the impact a weakness has on the correctness and utility of the

66
00:05:11,095 --> 00:05:16,495
results Some Weaknesses are fatal flaws so we can no longer trust the results we get.

67
00:05:16,495 --> 00:05:21,810
Other weaknesses, however, are caveats that we needed to acknowledge and account for when we

68
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:26,380
apply the results but they don't fundamentally undermine their validity.

69
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:31,305
I also want you to be able to reason about the ethical implications of your work.

70
00:05:31,305 --> 00:05:35,735
There's a variety of different frameworks and perspectives that we can take on the ethics of

71
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:39,975
data science work that we're going to be talking about this semester, but I want you to be able

72
00:05:39,975 --> 00:05:46,215
to think about and account for, and assess the ethical implications of data science work.

73
00:05:46,215 --> 00:05:51,880
And then finally, I want you to understand how the broader picture of data science, the

74
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:58,145
various techniques and applications fit into a framework, to give you a map of the space.

75
00:05:58,145 --> 00:06:03,470
And particularly with the role this class plays in Boise state's graduate curriculum, I want to

76
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:08,795
give you a framework that you can use to relate what you're going to learn in other classes such

77
00:06:08,795 --> 00:06:14,270
as machine learning or large-scale data analysis or recommender systems or social media mining

78
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:20,455
together and develop a coherent picture of what it is to do data science.

79
00:06:20,455 --> 00:06:25,325
To support these outcomes, there are a number of components of the class. The first is the videos and readings.

80
00:06:25,325 --> 00:06:30,695
You're watching one of those videos right now. This is going to be the primary mechanism for content delivery.

81
00:06:30,695 --> 00:06:35,790
I'm not planning to lecture live in class. I'll be doing a little bit of lecture style things

82
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:40,945
here and there as we need to clear up things that are confusing or things you have questions about.

83
00:06:40,945 --> 00:06:46,095
But our primary content delivery is going to be through these prerecorded lecture videos.

84
00:06:46,095 --> 00:06:50,390
The website is your guide to all of this. Each week is going to have a page that lays out the

85
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:54,173
videos, the readings that you need to do in order to be prepared for class,

86
00:06:54,173 --> 00:06:58,130
prepared for the assignments, and to learn the material.

87
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:02,650
Our in-class meetings are going to be focused on discussing and applying the material.

88
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:05,595
Some of that will be open discussion. Some of that will be guided

89
00:07:05,595 --> 00:07:09,495
application exercises carried out with your classmates.

90
00:07:09,495 --> 00:07:14,305
We're going to be having some quizzes ; particularly each Thursday there's going to be a quiz before class.

91
00:07:14,305 --> 00:07:20,330
That assesses your understanding of the material and gives both you and I an initial check on

92
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:26,265
how well you're understanding it and whether you're ready to apply it in our in-class work and in the assignment.

93
00:07:26,265 --> 00:07:29,025
We're going to have assignments that come at a relatively

94
00:07:29,025 --> 00:07:31,880
steady pace throughout the semester : one every other week.

95
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:36,415
They give you more extended place to practice and develop your skills and demonstrate your

96
00:07:36,415 --> 00:07:39,925
mastery of the material that we're going to be covering this semester.

97
00:07:39,925 --> 00:07:45,525
And then finally we have two midterm exams and a final exam to give an additional check of your

98
00:07:45,525 --> 00:07:48,970
conceptual knowledge of what it is that we're doing in this class.

99
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:54,190
As we go through the semester I expect you're probably going to have questions and you're going to need some help.

100
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:57,590
And there's a variety of places You can get it, you can get it in our class

101
00:07:57,590 --> 00:08:01,590
meetings both from your peers in the class and from me.

102
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:05,505
You can get it at any time through the class forum on Piazza.

103
00:08:05,505 --> 00:08:10,100
I strongly encourage you to ask questions and answer each other's questions on Piazza.

104
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:13,935
When you ask a question I'm probably not going to answer it immediately ; I'm going to give some

105
00:08:13,935 --> 00:08:17,195
time in order to see if others have an answer first.

106
00:08:17,195 --> 00:08:22,965
Oftentimes helping other people answer questions strengthens our own understanding of the material.

107
00:08:22,965 --> 00:08:29,290
So I encourage you to make use of Piazza both to answer your get your questions answered and to

108
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:32,865
develop and practice your understanding of the material through helping each other.

109
00:08:32,865 --> 00:08:38,080
I am going to be having office hours. I'm going to be having them physically in my office so long as health permits.

110
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,585
And I will also be able to have remote office hours by appointment.

111
00:08:42,585 --> 00:08:46,550
I do ask that if you have any inquiries about the class that you direct them through Piazza.

112
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:49,595
If it's something that's just for me, perhaps about grades or

113
00:08:49,595 --> 00:08:53,005
something, you can send a private message to the instructors on Piazza.

114
00:08:53,005 --> 00:08:56,010
That's going to let me keep all of my course communications in one

115
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:59,515
place, so I don't accidentally lose something in my email.

116
00:08:59,515 --> 00:09:04,059
And finally you can use the internet as a resource. There's a lot of documentation, resources

117
00:09:04,059 --> 00:09:07,175
, Many of our readings are going to come from various places on the internet.

118
00:09:07,175 --> 00:09:10,700
There's many more sites where you can search for solutions and help.

119
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:13,735
Also I encourage you to make use of public Q&A sites.

120
00:09:13,735 --> 00:09:16,350
When you're a practicing data scientist after this

121
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:19,625
class, the internet is at your disposal for getting your work done.

122
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:26,020
There's no reason not to go ahead and practice making use of the resources that are available to you in this class.

123
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:31,550
I just ask that you do it in a way that's in keeping with the principles of academic integrity.

124
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:36,440
You can go onto a public Q and a site and you can ask “I'm trying to do this thing I'm having a

125
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:41,745
problem”, and ask a specific question about the problem that you're getting stuck on.

126
00:09:41,745 --> 00:09:46,190
I don't want you to just copy in a piece of the assignment description, paste it in a question

127
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:52,470
answer site and ask “how do I do this ?” Demonstrate your learning of the material in how you go

128
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:57,185
about identifying where it is that you're stuck and asking a question that's going to help

129
00:09:57,185 --> 00:10:01,590
uncover the missing piece that you need in order to move forward.

130
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:05,135
So with all of that this class is designed to provide flexibility in

131
00:10:05,135 --> 00:10:09,120
learning and to use each modality to its best advantage.

132
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:14,220
There are trade-offs I'm not going to pretend like there's no trade-offs to how I've designed this class.

133
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:19,145
But with this design we can do the content delivery (me lecturing) in a way where you can go

134
00:10:19,145 --> 00:10:23,165
back and rewatch videos later, you can catch up if you

135
00:10:23,165 --> 00:10:27,485
have to miss some material, you can speed up the video if I talk too slow.

136
00:10:27,485 --> 00:10:30,790
We're going to focus our in-class time on things that can

137
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:34,570
only be done through synchronous discussion.

138
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:39,355
Where we're actually engaging with the material together and talking to each other about it.

139
00:10:39,355 --> 00:10:42,850
And these things together with the various parts of the class I

140
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:46,495
hope are going to allow us to achieve our learning outcomes for the semester.

141
00:10:46,495 --> 00:10:49,660
I hope you have a great semester. I hope you learn a lot.

142
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:54,610
I also expect to learn from you. Every time I teach It's a learning experience for me as well.

143
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:58,665
And I learn more about the subject and about how to teach and communicate

144
00:10:58,665 --> 00:11:03,263
about it from my students. So let's learn together…
