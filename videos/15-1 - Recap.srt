00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:12,230
Welcome. This is the last week of CSI 533. I want to start us off by doing some recap of what we've learned this semester.

2
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:18,830
The point to where we're gonna go in the last week or so are learning outcomes for this week or to tie up the class content together.

3
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:21,980
Give you a brief summary of what we've done, how it fits into the broader,

4
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:29,720
how it forms a broader picture into which the further topics you're going to study throughout your graduate degree will fit.

5
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:37,400
We're also going to tie up a couple of loose ends. We're going to talk about time, serious operations and modeling correlated regression errors.

6
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:42,170
And we're going to talk about how some of the things you need to do to take data science analysis,

7
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:48,260
results and outputs into publication or into production.

8
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:54,020
And then finally, I'm going to talk about some topics to study further to expand your data science skills.

9
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:57,950
So we've talked about the data science where I want to bring up the state of the science workflow again,

10
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:03,260
because it provides a context in which a lot of the things that we've been talking about fit.

11
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:08,690
We talk about how to describe data. We talk about how to integrate it, source it and transform it.

12
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:16,610
We talk about the various kinds of biases and you have to pay attention to throughout this workflow.

13
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:21,850
We have different kinds of tasks, such as modeling and inference.

14
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:28,060
I also want to return us, though, to our question at the beginning of this semester or our definition from the beginning of this semester,

15
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:35,280
that data science is the use of data to provide quantitative insights on questions of scientific business or social interest.

16
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,820
So the goal of all of this, what we're doing with data science, is to produce insights.

17
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:41,600
Now, there's a lot of overlap.

18
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:48,880
There's a lot of predictive predictive tools that are not necessarily being used to provide insights back to the operators,

19
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:55,690
but are being used to, say, generate predictions about customer transactions,

20
00:01:55,690 --> 00:02:02,710
about whether something is fraud, whether something is a cybersecurity attack,

21
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:08,680
that the the action itself is not necessarily the model itself is not necessarily providing insights.

22
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:14,530
But we need to gain insights about whether it's working, how effective it is, where we need to go, try to improve it.

23
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:18,370
But also the techniques that we're using are applicable to other purposes as well,

24
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:22,720
such as training, machine learning models that can do various types of predictions.

25
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:28,660
We've talked about data management, so we've put primarily focused on reading from static files.

26
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:34,570
We do a little bit with obtaining data from the web. We've been processing and integrating our data with pandas.

27
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:40,720
Really useful utility skill. To take this a step further is to actually to be able to work with a database.

28
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:51,400
And so in the CSA five 10 class databases, you learn how to design data models and relational databases, how to query them, how to put data in them.

29
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:59,470
You're also going to see in other classes information about managing data that is particular to different applications and types of data.

30
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:02,320
We talked about some mathematical fundamentals, probability theory.

31
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:07,030
We talked a little bit about some linear algebra and we've used bits and pieces of it throughout the class.

32
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:15,680
You can learn a lot more about these taking math 562 and taking the linear algebra class as well.

33
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:21,680
Four. We've talked about statistical inference. We did some basic parametric pairwise comparisons with T tests.

34
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,250
We learned how to bootstrap confidence intervals and P values.

35
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:31,010
We learned some sampling theory that underlies a lot of statistical inference and underlies the bootstrap.

36
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:35,000
And we talked about doing inference with regression models to learn a lot.

37
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,120
You'll learn a lot more about this and the probability and statistics class. We've done some predictions.

38
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:46,790
We've predicted continuous outcomes with regression models. We've predicted binary outcomes with classification models.

39
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:54,410
You will learn a lot more about different models for doing. For doing these kinds of predictions in the machine learning class.

40
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:58,370
And they're also going to come up throughout a number of your other data science classes,

41
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:05,700
such as recommender systems, natural language processing, information retrieval and social media mining.

42
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:12,180
We talked about evaluating your your predictive model, your classifier or your regression based predictor.

43
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:16,110
We talked about how to do. How to do train test splits, why we need those.

44
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:20,400
We talked about metrics for assessing the effectiveness of your model.

45
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:28,650
We talked about strategies that set up to choose your models, hyper parameters. Again, you're going to see a lot more of this in C.S. 534.

46
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:30,540
We also introduced unsupervised learning.

47
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:36,570
We've looked at two different unsupervised learning techniques where we don't oppose the predictions that we're trying to do,

48
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:39,990
the supervised learning where we have a classification outcome or a label.

49
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:45,320
We're trying to predict the classifier. We have a value. We're trying to predict with a regression model.

50
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:53,010
We don't have a supervisions ignore a label that we're trying to predict. We're trying to allow the model to obtain.

51
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:58,900
To learn structure just from the input features,

52
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:04,800
we've seen how to do this with lower dimensional embedding with Matrix composition, and we've seen how to do this with clustering.

53
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,150
Again, you'll see more about this in machine learning and it'll appear in other classes.

54
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:12,120
We talked about workflows. We talked about the data science pipeline.

55
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:18,930
We talked about how to break code into scripts and modules, how to use get how to design, has some design pattern for your code workflows.

56
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:27,300
You're going to use this throughout your data science work, both in your studies and in your applied work when you're done.

57
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:35,040
I encourage you to take what you've learned here, refer back to the material in order to structure your assignments for other classes.

58
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:41,700
So to wrap up, this class has been designed to lay a conceptual foundation for the rest of your data science studies.

59
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:45,570
So do you take other classes? You have these concepts. You know what a classifier is.

60
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:51,930
You know how to evaluate one. You know how predictive models and statistical inference fit in the broader space.

61
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:59,810
You have a good working base to start to work with data, be able to ask questions, be able to think about how.

62
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:07,940
How to answer them and represent their answers. Other classes are going to build on these concepts and ideas.

63
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:10,640
And there's a number that you can take in the computer science department,

64
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:23,036
the math department and other departments as you complete either your master's degree or your HD.
