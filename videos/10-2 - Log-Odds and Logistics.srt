00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:09,290
Hello. This video, I want to introduce the concept of odds and log odds,

2
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:12,920
learning outcomes are to be able to convert between probability odds and log odds

3
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:21,820
and understand the role and the purpose of the logistic and logic functions.

4
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:31,510
So if we have a probability of success. Probability is not the only way to quantify a probability.

5
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:39,880
We can also quantify it. And what's her called? The odds. So if you've heard of odds of like ten to one against odds of two to one.

6
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:44,550
This is what it's talking about. So if we have a probability of success.

7
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:49,120
And remember, this is going to be in the range zero less than or equal.

8
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:55,200
So probability is going to be in the range zero to one.

9
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:59,040
We can't actually have probabilities of zero and one when we're talking about odds four.

10
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:07,050
I'll get to that in a moment, but the odds is the probability of success.

11
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:13,980
Divided by the probability of failure or the probability of success, divided by the probability of one minus success.

12
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:20,100
And it gives us this ratio of the likelihood of one outcome versus the other.

13
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:26,450
And how much it expresses odds expresses how much more likely.

14
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:35,230
Success is than failure or failure is then success if we're quantifying the odds of failure.

15
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:38,860
So a couple of examples. Star Wars robots.

16
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:42,970
A couple of them talk differently, some in some in probability and some odds.

17
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:47,620
K2 Esso says there's a ninety seven point six percent chance of failure.

18
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:53,200
So our probability of failure is ninety seven point six. Point nine, seven, six.

19
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:58,230
And so our odds are point nine seven six divided by pointing to four.

20
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:01,800
Which is equal to forty point six seven. So we affect it.

21
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:11,380
We approximately have a forty one to one odds. The odds against success are the odds of failure are forty one to one.

22
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:19,620
That if we're going to translate this ninety seven point six percent chance into OD's, we can also translate the other way around.

23
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:25,320
See through Apio is being a little imprecise in his speech.

24
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:31,950
He should say the odds. The odds against successfully navigating an asteroid field.

25
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:38,160
But he says the possibility of successfully navigating will forgive him because he's talking about a ratio 37 20 to one.

26
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:45,210
He's clearly talking about odds. And so if the odds are thirty seven, twenty over one, that's equal to P. over one minus P.

27
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:51,990
If we solve that equation, what we're going to get is that the probability of failure, if we converting this odds of thirty seven,

28
00:02:51,990 --> 00:03:00,640
twenty to one, that we get a probability of failure of point nine nine nine seven or ninety nine point nine seven.

29
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,750
And so we can convert back and forth between probability and odds.

30
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:08,740
So long as our probability is not zero or one, we can't.

31
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:14,620
If probability is zero, then the odds will be zero.

32
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:18,790
But if the probability is one, then the probability of failure will be zero.

33
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:29,920
And so the odds will be infinite. Another thing about odds is that P is equal to zero point five, then odds is equal to one.

34
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:35,180
So one is even odds. Just as likely as it is unlikely.

35
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:47,090
Now, hopefully you may remember from high school algebra, logarithms and logarithms allow us to convert between exponents and.

36
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:58,310
In normal numbers, and so if X is the log base B of Y, that means Y is equal to be to the X logarithms undo exponentiation.

37
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:02,000
A few common bases. We have E the natural log. That's the one we use.

38
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,550
By far the most. We have log 10. That's really useful for doing orders of magnitude.

39
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:11,480
And when we plot on a log access, that log is almost always log.

40
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:16,970
Ten logs and different bases are proportional to each other, just a constant multiplier.

41
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:26,960
And so we have the we can have E for a lot of computations based 10 logs for displaying log axes and plots.

42
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:34,360
Sometimes you're gonna see base two logs when we're dealing, particularly dealing with low level operations and computer programing.

43
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:40,220
NUM Pi has the function log, which is the natural log and log 10, which is the base 10 log.

44
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:44,090
So a couple logarithms have a variety of identities.

45
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:49,350
If you're going to multiply two numbers, you can that's equivalent to adding their logarithm.

46
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:59,720
So log of X Y is equal to log of X plus log of Y. Exponentiation is multiplying the logarithm to the log of X to the Y as Y times the log of X.

47
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:04,100
These identities are useful for reasoning about what's happening with your logarithms.

48
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:09,410
Logarithms are only defined for X greater than zero.

49
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:17,440
And so. In a moment, we're going to get to log odds in which you so your.

50
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:22,840
The probability can't be won and allow you to convert to odds, because then you're going to have infinite,

51
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:29,640
infinite odds and it can't be zero and convert to law gods because you have zero and you can't take the log of zero.

52
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:38,460
One common operation when we do have some zeroes is to take the log of one plus X and this and num PI has a function that does that very,

53
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:45,570
very precisely. If you need to do log of one plus X, don't just do log of one plus X two log one P floating point is a weird beast.

54
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:50,160
I'm going to post a reading or two free to learn more about what's going on with floating point.

55
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:55,740
But logarithms are very useful for compute because they will help us avoid floating point under or overflow.

56
00:05:55,740 --> 00:06:05,220
And so very, very small probabilities. We'll have logarithms that are still within the reasonable range that we can store.

57
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:08,700
Also, though, you have to be a little bit careful because in flooding point arithmetic.

58
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:13,200
So in addition and subtraction are more efficient than multiplication and division.

59
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:19,320
So if you do the logarithms in your computations, the more efficient they stay in a more useful range of values many times.

60
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:22,830
But you have to be a little bit careful with particularly subtraction,

61
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:29,850
but also addition and floating point to avoid problems with precision and cancelation.

62
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:33,250
Again, I'm going to post a couple of reading or two about that.

63
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:39,490
But we have our odds and we have our logarithms, so now we can get to law gods or add logs.

64
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:44,350
But we can go to log odds. And so the log odds is the log of the odds.

65
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:55,480
And so it's the log of p0 ovei times one minus PMA, which is equal to log of P of a minus the log of one minus P of A.

66
00:06:55,480 --> 00:07:01,240
Because multiplication is addition. Division is subtraction. This function has a name.

67
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:06,220
This log God's function is called the logic and the logic of P is equal to

68
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:15,010
log P minus log of one minus P or log the P of log of P over one minus P and.

69
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:21,370
This converts odd or this converts probability into odds to go back.

70
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:29,370
It would convert K to S.O. indices through Pyo. The logistic function is the inverse of the logic.

71
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:38,460
So the logic is the log, the logistic is one over one plus E, the minus X, equivalently, it's either the X over each of the X plus one.

72
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:45,210
And it has a curve like this. The logic, the logistic of zero is point five as logistic goes to infinity.

73
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:50,700
This approaches one. As it goes to negative infinity, it approaches zero.

74
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:55,230
So it maps unbounded real values into the range zero one.

75
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:59,550
This is very useful because we have zero one outcomes.

76
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:04,350
It allows us to have an unbounded value that predicts it and it gets us into zero

77
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:15,390
ones without having to do clamping or anything else that's not differentiable. It also often when you.

78
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:17,360
You might have a zero one outcome variable. OK?

79
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:24,810
That's not not the 01 isn't normal or Pritam probabilities often aren't normal because they're bounded in this range zero one.

80
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:32,800
But it's not uncommon to find a situation where the logic of probabilities is normal.

81
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:43,170
And so you can if the logic of your probabilities is normal, then that lets you apply that like the law gods is normal.

82
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:47,160
So that lets you apply things that, like normal numbers,

83
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:55,020
normally distributed numbers to the log odds and then convert them back into probabilities with the logistic function.

84
00:08:55,020 --> 00:09:00,980
When you actually need a probability, the logistic function is also an example of what's called a sigmoid curve.

85
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:06,120
S shaped curve. As I said, it converts log odds in the probability.

86
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:16,630
So odds are another way of representing probabilities and the logistic and logic functions convert between probabilities and the log odds and odds.

87
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:25,720
The odds of one is even log odds of zero is even log odds.

88
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:30,640
Zero. When odds equals one.

89
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:43,340
So and also they're more their balance. So. The odds of two to one is two, odds of one to two is point five.

90
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:49,220
Odds of long odds of two to one is just a little under one.

91
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:53,990
And the drug odds of one to two is just a little over negative one.

92
00:09:53,990 --> 00:10:04,767
So it gives you more symmetry, more balance in the law. Become very computationally useful to work with.
