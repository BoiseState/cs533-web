1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,151


2
00:00:00,151 --> 00:00:02,042
Hello and welcome to CS 533.

3
00:00:02,042 --> 00:00:02,341


4
00:00:02,341 --> 00:00:05,320
Whether this is your first class
at Boise State or your 30th,

5
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:08,340
I'm very pleased to welcome you to
Introduction to Data Science.

6
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:10,440
I'm Michael Ekstrand, your professor for this fall,

7
00:00:10,441 --> 00:00:15,002
and in this video I wanted to give you an
introduction to what to expect this fall,

8
00:00:15,002 --> 00:00:15,241


9
00:00:15,241 --> 00:00:19,772
how I've structured the class to make use
of the different modalities available to us.

10
00:00:19,772 --> 00:00:20,131


11
00:00:20,131 --> 00:00:25,017
How to prepare ahead, if you're looking
to get a jump start on the semester,

12
00:00:25,017 --> 00:00:28,791
and to talk a little bit about how to succeed

13
00:00:28,791 --> 00:00:33,752
in a semester that's going to look more normal
than the last couple of semesters, hopefully.

14
00:00:33,752 --> 00:00:33,991


15
00:00:33,991 --> 00:00:43,292
But still, we have a lot of lingering public health risks
that we need to to be prepared for and be flexible for.

16
00:00:43,292 --> 00:00:44,011


17
00:00:44,011 --> 00:00:46,829
There are several components
of this class, and the overall structure

18
00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:50,821
may be a little bit different than what
you might be used to from other classes.

19
00:00:50,821 --> 00:00:52,824
There are a couple of reasons for this.

20
00:00:52,824 --> 00:00:58,712
One is to give the flexibility needed in
order to complete the semester successfully,

21
00:00:58,712 --> 00:00:58,891


22
00:00:58,891 --> 00:01:03,126
no matter what curveballs may come our way,
to enable you to get to get caught up

23
00:01:03,126 --> 00:01:05,172
if you have to miss class for a little while

24
00:01:05,172 --> 00:01:10,191
and also to make use of the each of the
different ways that we can interact

25
00:01:10,191 --> 00:01:15,212
in a way that captures the unique
potential of that particular interaction method.

26
00:01:15,212 --> 00:01:15,421


27
00:01:15,421 --> 00:01:19,772
So to start with, I'm not actually
going to be lecturing in class very much.

28
00:01:19,772 --> 00:01:19,921


29
00:01:19,921 --> 00:01:25,262
The primary content delivery is going to be
through online video lectures and readings.

30
00:01:25,262 --> 00:01:25,621


31
00:01:25,621 --> 00:01:28,616
The course website is going to
contain all of those.

32
00:01:28,616 --> 00:01:32,072
So for each week you can scroll through
and you can see that week's readings,

33
00:01:32,072 --> 00:01:32,311


34
00:01:32,311 --> 00:01:39,242
you can get access to my lecture slides,
you can watch the videos and rewatch them at your own pace.

35
00:01:39,242 --> 00:01:41,201


36
00:01:41,201 --> 00:01:45,522
We're going to use our synchronous time,
when we're meeting together in real time,

37
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:45,731


38
00:01:45,731 --> 00:01:50,431
whether it's in-person in this classroom
or online via Zoom

39
00:01:50,431 --> 00:01:56,681
to do those things which are really best
and sometimes only done with synchronous,

40
00:01:56,681 --> 00:01:58,766
real time communication.

41
00:01:58,766 --> 00:02:00,851
We're going to be discussing the material.

42
00:02:00,851 --> 00:02:04,116
We're going to be doing application
exercises in small groups

43
00:02:04,116 --> 00:02:07,782
with your classmates to practice
and solidify your understanding.

44
00:02:07,782 --> 00:02:08,201


45
00:02:08,201 --> 00:02:12,701
There will be opportunity to ask questions,
and I might do little mini lectures

46
00:02:12,701 --> 00:02:14,682
in order to clear up some of your understanding.

47
00:02:14,682 --> 00:02:14,951
 

48
00:02:14,951 --> 00:02:20,233
We're going to be having 
short team tests to allow you

49
00:02:20,233 --> 00:02:23,770
together check and improve
your understanding

50
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:27,401
of the material that you've seen
in the online video lectures.

51
00:02:27,401 --> 00:02:29,410
That's going to be on Thursdays.

52
00:02:29,411 --> 00:02:35,171
Tuesdays are going to be a remote
online synchronous time that's unstructured.

53
00:02:35,171 --> 00:02:40,121
I'll be signed into the course Zoom
and you can sign in and ask questions.

54
00:02:40,121 --> 00:02:40,160


55
00:02:40,161 --> 00:02:45,435
It'll basically be open Q&A and discussion
on the material that we're working through

56
00:02:45,435 --> 00:02:47,922
and a little bit of extended group office hours.

57
00:02:47,922 --> 00:02:48,851


58
00:02:48,851 --> 00:02:52,921
Science and data science are social processes.

59
00:02:52,921 --> 00:02:55,392
As we'll see as we get into the material next week,

60
00:02:55,392 --> 00:02:56,741


61
00:02:56,741 --> 00:03:01,226
Data only turns into meaning
as people give it meaning,

62
00:03:01,226 --> 00:03:05,712
and that happens in communication with others.

63
00:03:05,712 --> 00:03:06,731


64
00:03:06,731 --> 00:03:09,986
We communicate our results
to our colleagues,

65
00:03:09,986 --> 00:03:13,242
whether they are our fellow students,
whether they're our colleagues in the workplace.

66
00:03:13,242 --> 00:03:13,511


67
00:03:13,511 --> 00:03:16,661
We communicate them to
our graduate advisors.

68
00:03:16,661 --> 00:03:19,812
We communicate them
to our supervisors.

69
00:03:19,812 --> 00:03:19,901


70
00:03:19,901 --> 00:03:24,682
We communicate them to the broader world
through the form of scientific papers

71
00:03:24,682 --> 00:03:24,751


72
00:03:24,751 --> 00:03:31,481
or white papers and technical reports
in commercial settings.

73
00:03:31,481 --> 00:03:37,371
Together we develop and we vet our interpretations

74
00:03:37,371 --> 00:03:40,333
and the meaning that we're deriving from the data

75
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:46,771
as we see whether others are convinced,
as we take their feedback and incorporate it.

76
00:03:46,771 --> 00:03:52,861
So we're going to be trying to use the time that we have together
to do that kind of thing so we can practice,

77
00:03:52,861 --> 00:03:57,902
so we can develop the set of skills that we need
in order to not only do data science,

78
00:03:57,902 --> 00:03:58,171


79
00:03:58,171 --> 00:04:03,971
but communicate our results persuasively
and understand and incorporate the feedback

80
00:04:03,971 --> 00:04:08,133
that's going to make them more rigorous,
more reliable, and more persuasive in the future.

81
00:04:08,133 --> 00:04:08,671


82
00:04:08,671 --> 00:04:13,401
These online lectures and our in-person
engagement are going to be supplemented with

83
00:04:13,401 --> 00:04:19,561
a set of assignments throughout the semester
to allow you to develop more extended practice

84
00:04:19,561 --> 00:04:21,968
with the material, concepts,
and techniques that we cover,

85
00:04:21,968 --> 00:04:26,672
and to demonstrate your ability to
apply them to more significant projects,

86
00:04:26,672 --> 00:04:26,940


87
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:29,610
both with code and with writing and visuals.

88
00:04:29,611 --> 00:04:30,060


89
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:35,988
We also have two midterm exams
and a final for you to demonstrate

90
00:04:35,988 --> 00:04:39,242
your understanding of key class concepts.

91
00:04:39,242 --> 00:04:39,601


92
00:04:39,601 --> 00:04:44,732
These are structured so that the workload
throughout the semester should be fairly even.

93
00:04:44,732 --> 00:04:45,031


94
00:04:45,031 --> 00:04:47,522
The assignments come at a pace every other week.

95
00:04:47,522 --> 00:04:47,671


96
00:04:47,671 --> 00:04:52,281
We don't have a big culminating project
at the end that you're going to have to

97
00:04:52,281 --> 00:04:54,392
do a significant amount of extra work.

98
00:04:54,392 --> 00:04:55,231


99
00:04:55,231 --> 00:04:58,892
You should have an even and
predictable load between the assignments,

100
00:04:58,892 --> 00:04:59,250


101
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:04,261
the exams, and our various class and
learning activities throughout the semester.

102
00:05:04,261 --> 00:05:04,920


103
00:05:04,921 --> 00:05:08,282
There's a lot of moving pieces here
that you need to keep track of in this class.

104
00:05:08,282 --> 00:05:08,291


105
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:13,562
So I want to give you a few tips for success,
both throughout the class and also in preparing for it.

106
00:05:13,562 --> 00:05:13,801


107
00:05:13,801 --> 00:05:15,521
The first is to read the syllabus.

108
00:05:15,521 --> 00:05:19,742
There's a lot of information in the syllabus
about the course structure, about the course policies,

109
00:05:19,742 --> 00:05:20,011


110
00:05:20,011 --> 00:05:25,652
including various policies to help us
plan ahead for the unexpected this semester.

111
00:05:25,652 --> 00:05:26,250


112
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:28,420
Also, keep up on the videos and readings.

113
00:05:28,421 --> 00:05:32,431
The first week of content is going to be
fully available before class even starts.

114
00:05:32,431 --> 00:05:34,475
If you want to start working ahead, you can.

115
00:05:34,475 --> 00:05:39,242
Thursday we're going to be having quizzes
on each week's reading material and videos.

116
00:05:39,242 --> 00:05:39,250


117
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:45,271
So work ahead, understand the material
and be prepared in order to take the quiz.

118
00:05:45,271 --> 00:05:45,420


119
00:05:45,421 --> 00:05:48,375
That's going to help both you and I
assess your understanding of the material

120
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:51,331
as we start working into applying it.

121
00:05:51,331 --> 00:05:51,690


122
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:56,161
I also encourage you to make use of the
features of the video interface.

123
00:05:56,161 --> 00:05:56,430


124
00:05:56,431 --> 00:06:01,112
Panopto allows you to change the playback
speed if I talk too quickly or too slowly for you.

125
00:06:01,112 --> 00:06:01,471


126
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:06,211
You can also download the videos
to watch them on your own device in another context.

127
00:06:06,211 --> 00:06:06,510


128
00:06:06,511 --> 00:06:09,572
I also recommend that you get started
on the assignments early.

129
00:06:09,572 --> 00:06:09,750


130
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:13,999
They're going to be up at the beginning
of the two week period before they're due

131
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,211
you can get started right away.

132
00:06:15,211 --> 00:06:18,706
And we're going to be giving time
early in the second week of the assignment

133
00:06:18,706 --> 00:06:24,024
for collaborative problem solving
and discussion on the assignment.

134
00:06:24,024 --> 00:06:28,381
You'll be able to take the best advantage
of that if you've already gotten started.

135
00:06:28,381 --> 00:06:29,520


136
00:06:29,521 --> 00:06:33,721
I'm here at the Idaho Anne Frank Human
Rights Memorial to conclude this video,

137
00:06:33,721 --> 00:06:36,121
because as we will see as we get into the material,

138
00:06:36,121 --> 00:06:39,902
many of the applications of data science
have a profound human impact.

139
00:06:39,902 --> 00:06:40,351


140
00:06:40,351 --> 00:06:44,882
We may be doing data science to understand
human behavior, the effects of human activity.

141
00:06:44,882 --> 00:06:45,571


142
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:49,491
We may be doing data science to make
decisions or recommendations

143
00:06:49,491 --> 00:06:50,792
that are going to affect people.

144
00:06:50,792 --> 00:06:51,091


145
00:06:51,091 --> 00:06:55,331
People will have to implement
many of the decisions that result from our analyses,

146
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:58,532
even when the analyses themselves
are not about human subjects.

147
00:06:58,532 --> 00:06:59,071


148
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:04,410
One of the goals of my teaching
and my research is to use technology -

149
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:08,882
data science, computing -
for human flourishing.

150
00:07:08,882 --> 00:07:09,211


151
00:07:09,211 --> 00:07:12,871
And so one of the things that
I want to equip you with in this class,

152
00:07:12,871 --> 00:07:16,104
besides the technical and the
mathematical and the conceptual

153
00:07:16,104 --> 00:07:19,744
underpinnings in order to carry
out the work of data science

154
00:07:19,744 --> 00:07:23,402
is tools to be able to understand
and reason about human impact,

155
00:07:23,402 --> 00:07:23,731


156
00:07:23,731 --> 00:07:28,442
to do data science in a way that
respects human dignity and advances justice.

157
00:07:28,442 --> 00:07:29,071


158
00:07:29,071 --> 00:07:34,352
And I also want this class itself
to work for the humans that affects: you.

159
00:07:34,352 --> 00:07:34,861


160
00:07:34,861 --> 00:07:37,699
So I have a design for how
the class is going to work,

161
00:07:37,699 --> 00:07:39,812
but there's also an ongoing conversation.

162
00:07:39,812 --> 00:07:40,051


163
00:07:40,051 --> 00:07:42,628
If you have concerns,
either in advance of the class,

164
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:45,901
or as the class progresses about what's happening,

165
00:07:45,901 --> 00:07:50,611
if there are things that are not working
for you, I want to hear about those.

166
00:07:50,611 --> 00:07:53,865
You can email me.
You can post me a message on Piazza.

167
00:07:53,865 --> 00:07:55,441
Can't guarantee I can fix everything.

168
00:07:55,441 --> 00:07:58,682
Some things I may need to take into
account for the next iteration of this class,

169
00:07:58,682 --> 00:07:58,921


170
00:07:58,921 --> 00:08:02,972
but I want it to work for you and I want
it to work for the students are going to come after you.

171
00:08:02,972 --> 00:08:03,331


172
00:08:03,331 --> 00:08:06,305
So with that, I look forward to seeing you in class.

173
00:08:06,305 --> 00:08:07,862
And let's learn some data science.
