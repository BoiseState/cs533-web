00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:07,330
This video, I want to give you a few general tips,

2
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:14,170
wrap up the semester with some suggestions and some advice for doing data science and for learning more.

3
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:18,670
So that's our learning outcome. Some concluding tips for your data science work.

4
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:23,710
The first is to never take your eye off of questions. Good questions are fundamental.

5
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:30,430
John Tukey, who developed a lot of important statistical concepts.

6
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:40,030
Is quoted as saying that it's far better to have an approximate answer to the right question than an exact answer to the wrong question.

7
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:48,280
If you have a good question that you can get insight into, even if you don't have a crisp and precise answer for it, you can often refine the answer.

8
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:52,060
But that's also often more illuminating for what you want to learn and for

9
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:56,740
what you want to what you need to do than a very precise answer to a question.

10
00:00:56,740 --> 00:01:01,570
That is not ultimately the question you want to ask. So.

11
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:10,020
Focus a lot of energy on defining your question properly and appropriately and understanding.

12
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:18,990
Understanding its relationship to contacts and to talk about that just a bit. And what your answer means to it and its limitations.

13
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:22,230
The second piece of advice is to work reproducibly. I've talked about this a little bit.

14
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:28,140
As we've been wrapping up, there's many reasons that you should make your analysis reproducible.

15
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:29,670
One, though, really important.

16
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:41,520
One is that when you go when you write up your results, either for a publication, for your thesis, for for a report, you need to know what you did.

17
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,430
And if you've been doing a bunch of different things, writing scripts, processing data here and there,

18
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:52,740
it's easy to lose track of exactly what steps got you from source data to conclusions.

19
00:01:52,740 --> 00:02:00,060
And if you put it into a reproducible pipeline where it's automated, ideally you can rerun the whole thing with one command or a few commands.

20
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:07,550
Then it's easy to make sure that you have accurately described all of the steps because you can check.

21
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:12,640
Do I describe the steps that are in my pipeline? And then you can try every running the pipeline to make sure it still works.

22
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:18,330
Do you still get the same conclusions? And if not. Either you missed the step or what you read.

23
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:22,960
What you reporting is the results of running a different set of steps or a set of steps in a different order.

24
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:28,350
So in addition to all of the the external scientific benefits of reproducibility,

25
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:34,530
the benefits of reproducibility for being able to maintain your model in the long run in production settings,

26
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:42,080
just for documentation purposes, the reproducibility helps you make sure that you've correctly described what it is that you did.

27
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,290
You never lose sight of the context of what you're doing.

28
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:52,380
There's a reason why when we talk to the very beginning of the semester about developing questions,

29
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:57,570
we start with goals and we have questions that are going to advance those goals, analysis to answer the questions.

30
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:00,650
And the analysis is of data.

31
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:07,280
We don't we we focus on a question, we're trying to answer the question that the question has to be precise in order for us to answer it.

32
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:14,030
But that question, as with the TOOKEY quote, it may well be an approximation for something we really care about.

33
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:20,440
And so. We don't want to. Once we define the question, we don't want to just focus on the question.

34
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:23,230
We need to keep the big picture in mind to remember why.

35
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:32,370
If we need to do further refinements of the question, we have a touchstone to look to to figure out how we need to revise the question.

36
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:35,850
If we need to adjust it, because our data can't answer that question.

37
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:41,100
Well, when your new question will, what new question is going to bridge between the data and our goals?

38
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:46,380
So we have some where we're going. It also helps. It's crucial for being able to contextualize our results.

39
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:53,280
Why do we care about the answer to this question? What does it mean for what we know about the world or for what we're trying to do in the world?

40
00:03:53,280 --> 00:04:00,970
It's crucial for helping identify limitations. If you know the goal and then you have a cutoff of goal, you've a question you can.

41
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:05,060
Having the goal gives you a place to context to talk about.

42
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:10,170
OK. So our question can do this. But there's these other things that are important to our goal that we can't do right now.

43
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:15,660
That's fine. It gives you a way to document them. It's also then super useful for generating next ideas.

44
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:20,340
Our question has taken us two steps towards our goal. Our goal goals still 10 steps away.

45
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:26,610
That's a lot of future work that's already written for us. But then also, we don't want to overlook detail.

46
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:32,550
So when we're specifying our questions and results, we need to be precise and specific about what exactly were measuring.

47
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:40,130
And this might seem that it's. This might at first glance seem to contradict the two key quote at the beginning is he said,

48
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:43,880
better to have the vague question than the precise wrong question.

49
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:51,170
But they're they're not really in conflict because whenever we're measuring something, we're measuring something very precise.

50
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:56,780
Computers and measurements are very precise things. We need to understand precisely what that is.

51
00:04:56,780 --> 00:05:03,470
And we need to understand the relationship between the precise thing we computed.

52
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:09,330
A measurement of. How many people?

53
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:16,630
Clicked. I've never seen this number before in our interface for dealing with incoming calls.

54
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:22,880
And we need to connect that to the vaguer question that we're trying to answer so we understand the approximation.

55
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:28,610
It's not enough to say, well, OK, I have I have the right question and I have an approximate answer to it.

56
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:36,590
We need to understand the approximation and the best of our ability, the relationship of that approximate of the precise thing we measured.

57
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:42,650
How what's an approximation of the question we're trying to answer and how that's then going to advance the goal we have?

58
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:52,590
We can't we can't overlook the details to understand precisely what it is that we're doing and different people approach.

59
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:58,040
Connecting data and goals in different ways. Some are very top down thinkers.

60
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:02,490
They start with the big picture goals. They're very focused on big picture things.

61
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:07,140
That's often my default mode of operation. I'm a relatively big picture person.

62
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:14,670
But in order to be a big picture person, effectively, you have to be able to connect that big picture with specific,

63
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:20,090
concrete, measurable things that are going to advance the big picture.

64
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:26,120
You can't if you don't do that, then you're going to wind up either not being able to make progress because you can't

65
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:30,710
actually define something actionable that's going to advance the big picture or

66
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:35,570
you're going to not have a clear sense of whether you're advancing it or going to make

67
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:40,820
a lot of unsubstantiated statements because you're not connecting to the details.

68
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:44,510
Some people start from the details, more bottom up development of ideas.

69
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:50,930
Neither of these are wrong. Different faculty in the department tend to start from top down or bottom up places.

70
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:59,450
You need to learn to be able to learn from people who communiqu, who structure ideas in both ways.

71
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:06,110
But bottom up, you start more with the data and the details of the problem, and you build that into a big picture.

72
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:12,110
And there you need to be able to connect to to see the context and not lose the context for what it is that you're doing.

73
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:19,160
Both are good ways to approach problems and are complementary perspectives that can work very well together.

74
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:26,930
But it's something to be aware of. You can't lose sight of either the context why you're doing the thing that you're doing or of the details to

75
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:35,270
understand what precisely it is did to be able to reason about how that relates to your context and your goals.

76
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:38,930
Be curious. There's so much to learn.

77
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:47,750
I am continually learning new things about programing, about statistics, about the problems that I'm trying to solve with with these techniques.

78
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:51,650
And so learn about that. I've given you some pointers of some things to read in these videos.

79
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:56,450
I've given you pointers elsewhere in the course materials. There's so much to go study.

80
00:07:56,450 --> 00:08:03,740
This class is intended to open the door to the world of data science that you can walk through and have.

81
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:13,610
A basic framework in which to fit all the new information that you're going to need to be acquiring over the next years.

82
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:21,740
Pause and reflect. And this applies to a lot of things. It applies to the work you're doing, reflect on what does this result mean?

83
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:26,630
Reflect on is my code efficient, is my code readable?

84
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:31,190
Does this chart makes sense? Reflect on your practices of work.

85
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:35,480
How am I organizing my work to go from my goals to my analysis?

86
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:41,870
How my organizing my to do list something I also tell my students is to take time to reflect on their practices.

87
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:46,070
How do you organize just overall your work as a student and to reflect?

88
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:50,960
Is this working for me? Am I having problems with my productivity, problems with getting things done?

89
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:54,770
Problems with communication problems? Or are maybe not.

90
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:58,820
Problems might be a harsh way to frame it. Are there places I can improve?

91
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:04,310
What's working about how I'm doing my work as a student? What's not working and how can I improve?

92
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:08,480
There's a there's a risk of spending so much time in your process for getting things done.

93
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:14,600
You never get things done. But it's important to reflect on our work, on its outcomes.

94
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:19,260
How could this paper be better? How could this report be better?

95
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:24,180
How can I do this kind of project better the next time it is done, it's published, it's good.

96
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:34,480
How can I do even better the next time? So to wrap up, good state of science requires ongoing reflection, study and practice.

97
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:41,790
Never stop learning, never stop paying attention to the various things like.

98
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:46,330
Ideas. Don't live well in little boxes.

99
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:51,250
There may be someone working on some completely different problem, but they're using.

100
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:54,760
They had an insight into their problem, which you can go apply to yours.

101
00:09:54,760 --> 00:10:02,860
So take advantage of the opportunity to go to a wide range of talks, to read or write a wide range of papers and a wide range of books,

102
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:09,750
etc., to get ideas for how you can do better work and how you can better understand your problems.

103
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:25,894
Space, the world around you, your customers, the needs of your organization in order to do better data science tomorrow than you did yesterday.
