00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:08,530
This video, I want to talk a little bit more about vector spaces, we've talked about them a little,

2
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:12,250
but we're going to talk about the concept in a little more detail now.

3
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:19,570
Want to formally introduce more formally introduced the concept of vector space and understand the idea of a vector space transformation.

4
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:27,490
We're only going to scratch the surface for a lot more. I recommend that you read a good linear algebra book.

5
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:34,090
So remember, vector is a vector is there's a sequence of numbers, an array, basically a one dimensional array.

6
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:40,510
So X X one X two X and that's the vector real's to the end is an end dimensional vector space.

7
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:45,870
In the real numbers, you vector spaces over other things to integers over.

8
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:52,920
Complex numbers over weird things, but it's an n dimensional vector space and we can do a few operations, the vector.

9
00:00:52,920 --> 00:01:00,180
We can add, subtract, we can multiply by a scalar. That's a real number, we can compute the inner product.

10
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:05,940
You cannot multiply multiplying two vectors, just I'm going to multiply defector's together is not an operation.

11
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:09,420
If you both apply to vectors and know what you're actually getting is the pairwise

12
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:13,830
multiplication like it multiplies the elements together if they're compatible sizes.

13
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:21,570
That is not actually a linear algebra operation. There is the inner product, which is the sum of the element Y's products.

14
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:28,900
And then there's a distance, which is the inner product of a subtraction with itself. And so we can have a matrix.

15
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:33,150
So we've got a sample exit rows and instance, each instance is a row vector.

16
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:38,340
As a row of this matrix X, we can do all the vector things with these rows.

17
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:49,650
Matrix, a matrix is, as we said in an earlier video. Is this this two dimensional array?

18
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:54,900
Of numbers. It's a collection of row vectors and it's a collection of Cullom vectors.

19
00:01:54,900 --> 00:02:03,600
It's also a linear map from one vector space to another. And the other one might be the same the the the same vector space in terms like it

20
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,970
might be n by n subtle map are an N dimensional vector to another N dimensional vector.

21
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:13,680
But it's had some transformations applied to it. There's a bunch of things we can do with matrices.

22
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,690
We can add them, multiply them by either a scalar or by a compatible matrix or vector.

23
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:25,110
We saw that earlier. You can transpose them, et cetera. There's a number of special matrices.

24
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:29,190
So we have column vectors which are m by one, remember, we always have rows first.

25
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:33,240
So M rose by one column is an M by one column vector.

26
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:37,890
One row by N columns is an it is a one by N row vector.

27
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:40,830
We can have a square matrix where the two dimensions are the same.

28
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:45,920
We can have a diagonal matrix that only had that zero everywhere except the diagonal.

29
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:54,380
So you've got your big matrix. It's got. The diagonal is non-zero.

30
00:02:54,380 --> 00:03:04,430
All of this is zero. You can have an identity matrix, which is a diagonal matrix where all the non-zero values are one.

31
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:12,710
You can have a triangular matrix where either the upper right. Or the lower left corner is non-zero and the other side is zero.

32
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:18,130
So it's the everything above and to the right of the diagonal is zero for a lower triangular matrix.

33
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:22,500
Everything down the left of the diagonal is zero for an upper triangular matrix.

34
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:28,240
Also a symmetric matrix, which is a square matrix where it's equal to its transpose.

35
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:32,350
So the top right corner is equal to the top bottom left corner.

36
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:38,230
You flip it. You flip the rows in the column and you get the same Matrix backout. You can also have what's called an orthogonal matrix,

37
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:45,230
where if a transpose times A is equal to the identity matrix, then you have an orthogonal matrix.

38
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:48,050
Matrix vector multiplication is super useful operation.

39
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:55,460
So if we've got an M byan matrix and we've gotten N dimensional column vector, then we can compute Y equals X and we can.

40
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:58,190
And this is going to be an M dimensional column vector.

41
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:04,610
And what we've done here is we have mapped X into another vector space or we've transformed it.

42
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:10,520
And even if even if the even if a a square. So it's from R and R n.

43
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:16,820
What we're doing we can apply this can transform the vector so that it's in it's in the same space.

44
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:23,240
But it is its relationships to other vectors have changed.

45
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:29,330
And it's effectively a. In the different organization of the same space for lack of a better term.

46
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:36,110
I'm trying to avoid getting deep into the linear algebra terms like so like change of basis and things.

47
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:39,970
Because I'm trying to give you the intuition for it.

48
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:47,120
And linear algebra class is gonna really eat either a class or a textbook or an online course is going

49
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:52,420
to help you shore up a lot of the details that you're going to need to dove deeper into linear algebra.

50
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:56,320
So multiplying by a matrix can give us a bunch of different transform.

51
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:01,930
We can reduce dimensionality. We can basically project, project and do other transformations.

52
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:06,400
So a projection is when you just strip off vectors. So if we have X.

53
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:13,570
So if we've got one seven. The projection of this under the first dimension is just one.

54
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:20,230
But you can also do some additional transformations at your besides just projection to get it down to a lower dimensional space.

55
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:28,100
One of the things you can do is translate. So if we've got here. We can translate it.

56
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:35,680
We've got Vector's. And we just shift them, same relationship to each other.

57
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:47,940
They're just moved. We can scale them so that they're going to this vector is going to.

58
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:54,860
Get a vector here. We can scale it.

59
00:05:54,860 --> 00:06:03,360
You can skew the space. You can also rotate within the space and any combination of these, you can do any linear transformation.

60
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,370
And actually this is what it means for something to be a linear transformation of linear

61
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:13,080
transformation is the transformation you can express through a matrix multiplication.

62
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:17,790
But also, we have linear systems, so linear systems are written as matrix vector operations.

63
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:29,510
We can solve this for Beda. So why is X better than Beda is equal is X inverse times Y.

64
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:34,730
If we want ordinarily, this is this is the direct exact solution to the linear equations.

65
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:40,250
But if they don't have a solution, we can get the least squared solution by solving a different system.

66
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:49,730
Multiply. X transpo solve, X transpose, Y equal to X transpose, x beda.

67
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:52,670
I missed it x there, I just wrote it in.

68
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:59,840
Now one particular note though is so I wrote a matrix inverse here matrix and versus an operation but usually don't actually want to perform it.

69
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,240
Matrix and Versus are almost always used for solving a system.

70
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:09,620
Linear equation solving the system is usually a better solution than actually inverting a matrix.

71
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:17,120
So wrap up vectors represent data points in a vector space. These can be manipulated and transform, particularly by multiplying them by a matrix.

72
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:27,300
I recommend that you can salties Lynge some linear algebra learning resources to learn a lot more.
