ROC CURVES
Learning Outcomes
Plot an accuracy curve
Compute and interpret a receiver operating characteristic curve.

Metrics and Tradeoffs
Metrics from the confusion matrix are hard yes/no.

A single classifier often has tradeoff points.
Precision Curve
Plot precision at different thresholds.

See tradeoff.

Can do for any metric.
Receiver Operating Characteristic
Plot TPR (Recall) vs. FPR

What FPR must you tolerate for a certain recall?

Diagonal line is random
Area Under the Curve
Compute area under curve (AUC)
0.5 is random
Greater is good (1 is perfect)
< 0.5, invert classifier
AUC and Probability
Wrapping Up
ROC curves give us a way to see tradeoffs and compare the tradeoff curves of multiple classifiers.
