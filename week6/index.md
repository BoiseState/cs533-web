:::{updated} F21
:::

:::{attention}
The first midterm exam is released on Wednesday.
:::

This week's learning outcomes are:

1.  Display two potentially-related numeric variables for exploratory analysis.
2.  Compute correlation coefficients between variables
3.  Run a linear regression

Since we have the exam this week, the lecture load is significantly reduced.

The first midterm is released on Wednesday on Canvas.  It is written to take about an
hour, and covers material up through and including Week 5.  It does not include
Week 6.

### Format

The first part of the exam is a short programming exercise.

The second part is a conceptual exam. it will contain a variety of questions to
assess your ability to understand and apply concepts from the class.  Question
formats include:

- Multiple-choice
- True/false
- Matching
- Fill-in-the-blank
- Short answer

I may ask you to do a range of things on the exam, including (but not limited to):

- Define a concept
- Compute a metric from a small quantity of data
- Interpret a chart

### Exam Rules

- Notes, books, class materials are allowed
- Asking other humans for help on the exam is not allowed

### Study Tips

- Review the previous quizzes and assignments.
- Review lecture slides to see where you are unclear on concepts and need to review.
- Skim assigned readings, particularly the section headings to remind yourself what was in them.
- Review the [course glossary](../glossary.md), keeping in mind that it does contain terms we haven't gotten to yet.
