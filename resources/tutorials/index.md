9.  [Sampling and Testing the Penguins](PenguinSamples.ipynb)
10. [Linear Models with scipy `minimize`](MinimizeRegression.ipynb)
11. [Overfitting Simulation example](OverfittingSimulation.ipynb)

## SciKit-Learn and ML Models

1.  [SciKit-Learn Logistic Regression](SciKitLogistic.ipynb)
2.  [SciKit-Learn Pipelines and Regularization](SciKitPipeline.ipynb) — also includes a significance test
3.  [Advanced SciKit-Learn pipeline and logistic regression example](https://towardsdatascience.com/logistic-regression-classifier-on-census-income-data-e1dbef0b5738) (on Towards Data Science)
4.  [Movie Decomposition](MovieDecomp.ipynb)
5.  [K-Means Example](ClusteringExample.ipynb) (uses the chi-papers data from [Week 13](../../week13/index.md#practice))
6.  [Tuning Hyperparameters](TuningExample.ipynb)

## Specific Data Set Examples

These are more advanced examples of data manipulation and collection:

1.  [MovieLens Time Series](MLTimeSeries.ipynb)
2.  [Sessionization](Sessions.ipynb) (demonstrates some more advanced aggregation and time-based operations)
3.  [Using the Census](UsingTheCensus.ipynb) describes how to access census data.
4.  [Fetching CHI Papers](FetchCHIPapers.ipynb) creates the `chi-papers.csv` file from Internet sources.

## Workflow Example

This example demonstrates a complete Git-based workflow:
