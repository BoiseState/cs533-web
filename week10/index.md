## {{mvideo}} The Confusion Matrix {: data-length="11m50s"}

The *confusion matrix* describes the outcomes of a classification model and is the basis for computing effectiveness metrics.

### Resources

- The [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confusion_matrix) has a very good diagram of the confusion matrix and its derived metrics.

## {{mnotebook}} Logistic Regression Demo

The [demo notebook](LogitRegressionDemo.ipynb) for the first-half videos.

## {{mdoc}} Floating Point

- [Floating Point Guide](https://floating-point-gui.de/)

This is provided for reference.

## {{mdoc}} StatsModels Documentation

The following StatsModels page documents its logistic regression:

- [Regression with Discrete Dependent Variable](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/discretemod.html)

This is **not** an assigned reading - it is here for your reference.

## {{mvideo}} Log Likelihood {: data-length="16m54s"}

This video describes the *log likelihood* that is the objective function used by logistic regression.

## {{mnotebook}} SciKit-Learn Logistic Regression

The [SciKit Logistic](./SciKitLogistic.ipynb) notebook demonstrates training and using a logistic regression classifier with SciKit-Learn.

## {{mvideo}} Receiver Operating Characteristic {: data-length="7m25s"}

This video introduces the *receiver operating characteristic* (ROC) curve, and its use in evaluating classifiers and selecting tradeoffs.

## :a-task: Practice

Load the Penguin data, and use a logistic regression to try to classify a penguin as Gentoo or Chinstrap using various measurements.
Delete the Adelie penguins first, so you have a binary classification problem.

## {{mvideo}} Biases and Assumptions {: data-length="22m"}

This video revisits sources of bias and discusses the assumptions underlying prediction.

Read Sections 1 and 2 of the following paper:

> Shira Mitchell, Eric Potash, Solon Barocas, Alexander D'Amour, Kristian Lum. 2018.
> [Prediction-Based Decisions and Fairness: A Catalogue of Choices, Assumptions, and Definitions](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.07867).
> arXiv:1811.07867 [stat.AP].

We'll come back to ideas here, but sections 1 and 2 describe the assumptions underlying most classification problems.

## {{mquiz}} Week 10 Quiz

The Week 10 quiz will be posted to Canvas.

:title: Abolish the #TechToPrison Pipeline
:::

Read [Abolish the #TechToPrison Pipeline](https://medium.com/@CoalitionForCriticalTechnology/abolish-the-techtoprisonpipeline-9b5b14366b16) (the Medium reading time estimate includes the thorough â€” and valuable â€” footnotes and list of 2435 signatories).
This article probes in more detail the assumptions underlying classes of criminal justice data science applications.

## {{massignment}} Assignment 5

[Assignment 5](../../assignments/A5/index.md) is due **November 7, 2020**.
