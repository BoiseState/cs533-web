## {{mvideo}} What is Classification?

In this video, I introduce the week and what classification is.

## {{mvideo}} Log-Odds and Logistics

In this video, I introduce {term}`log odds`, along with the *{term}`logistic function`* and its inverse, 
the *{term}`logit function`*.
Log odds are a useful concept in many situations!

## {{mvideo}} Logistic Regression

We're now ready for our first classification model: *logistic regression*.

## {{mvideo}} The Confusion Matrix

The *confusion matrix* describes the outcomes of a classification model and is the basis for computing effectiveness metrics.

:::{note}
I am going to re-record this video before finalizing Week 10.

### Resources

- The [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confusion_matrix) has a very good diagram of the confusion matrix and its derived metrics.

## {{mnotebook}} Logistic Regression Demo

The [demo notebook](LogitRegressionDemo.ipynb) for the first-half videos.

## {{mdoc}} Floating Point

- [Floating Point Guide](https://floating-point-gui.de/)

This is provided for reference.

## {{mdoc}} StatsModels Documentation

The following StatsModels page documents its logistic regression:

- [Regression with Discrete Dependent Variable](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/discretemod.html)

This is **not** an assigned reading - it is here for your reference.

## {{mvideo}} Log Likelihood

This video describes the *log likelihood* that is the objective function used by logistic regression.

## {{mnotebook}} SciKit-Learn Logistic Regression

The [SciKit Logistic](./SciKitLogistic.ipynb) notebook demonstrates training and using
{py:class}`sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression`.

## {{mvideo}} Receiver Operating Characteristic

This video introduces the *receiver operating characteristic* (ROC) curve, and its use in evaluating classifiers and selecting tradeoffs.

## {{mtask}} Practice

Load the Penguin data, and use a logistic regression to try to classify a penguin as Gentoo or Chinstrap using various measurements.
Delete the Adelie penguins first, so you have a binary classification problem.

## {{mvideo}} Biases and Assumptions

This video revisits sources of bias and discusses the assumptions underlying prediction.

## {{mdoc}} Prediction-Based Decisions

:::{reading} pdb
:title: Prediction-Based Decisions and Fairness

:::

Read Sections 1 and 2 of the following paper:

> Shira Mitchell, Eric Potash, Solon Barocas, Alexander D'Amour, Kristian Lum. 2018.
> [Prediction-Based Decisions and Fairness: A Catalogue of Choices, Assumptions, and Definitions](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.07867).
> arXiv:1811.07867 [stat.AP].

We'll come back to ideas here, but sections 1 and 2 describe the assumptions underlying most classification problems.

If you would like to learn more, I recommend:

## {{mquiz}} Week 10 Quiz

The Week 10 quiz will be posted to Canvas.

## {{mdoc}} Abolish the #TechToPrison Pipeline

:title: "Abolish the #TechToPrison Pipeline"
:::

Read [Abolish the #TechToPrison Pipeline](https://medium.com/@CoalitionForCriticalTechnology/abolish-the-techtoprisonpipeline-9b5b14366b16) (the Medium reading time estimate includes the thorough â€” and valuable â€” footnotes and list of 2435 signatories).
This article probes in more detail the assumptions underlying classes of criminal justice data science applications.

## {{massignment}} Assignment 5

[Assignment 5](../../assignments/A5/index.md) is due **November 7, 2020**.
