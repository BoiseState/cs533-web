# ðŸš§ Week 14 â€” Workflow ({date}`wk14 range`) ðŸš§

:::{draft}
This content is still in draft state and has not yet been finalized.
:::

In this week, we are going to talk more about *workflows*.
What does it look like to build a practical data science pipeline?

## {{mvideo}} Extract, Transform, Load

The Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) pipeline is a common design pattern for data ingest.
Sometimes it is adjusted to Extract, Load, Transform.
