illuminate questions of interest.\n\n\nDefine and operationalize a research question such that a data analysis could produce meaningful knowledge.\n\n\nUse best practices to carry out analyses in a documented, reproducible, and efficient fashion.\n\n\nPresent the results of a data analysis with appropriate visuals and written argument.\n\n\nIdentify weaknesses in a data analysis and assess their impact on the correctness and utility of the results.\n\n\nAssess ethical implications of an analysis in terms of both classical human subject research ethics and contemporary concerns such as

Each late day extends an assignment deadline by 24 hours with no penalty.  When submitting an assignment using a late day, state with your submission the number of days you are using.  I would appreciate it if you notify me prior to the deadline of your intention to use one or more late days, but this is not mandatory.\n\n\nLate days are indivisible; submitting an assignment 12 hours late requires an entire late day.\n\n\nThis policy is designed to accommodate most ordinary need for extensions or late submissions. Therefore, no other late work will be accepted. Assignments must be turned in on time and you must take exams at their scheduled times.\n\n\nExceptions to this policy will only be granted in extreme circumstances. Any requests for individual exceptions must be submitted by e-mail so that I have a record of the request and my response.\n\n\n\n\nConduct and Classroom Civility\n\n\nI expect you to behave in a civil, respectful manner in all class interactions, both in official meetings such as lectures and out-of-class activities, and to contribute to a constructive learning environment.

While I aim to allow you to make reasonable use of resources, cheating (including copying code, using unauthorized resources during tests, etc.) will not be tolerated. If you are found to be cheating, the penalty may range from failing the assignment to failing the course, and will also be reported to the university.\n\n\n\n\nDisability Accommodations\n\n\nIf you need particular accommodations to be able to fully participate in this course, please talk with me as soon as possible.

To access Onyx, connect via SSH to onyx.boisestate.edu.\n\n\nWorking directly on the onyx head node will not work for our data analysis projects â€” you wil need to work on an individual Onyx node.\n\n\n\n\nAccessing Onyx Nodes\n\n\n\nYou first need an ssh client. For Windows use MobaXterm; on Linux and Mac the client should already be installed and accessible from the command line.\n\n\nConnect to Onyx through ssh. You will do this through the command line (MobaXterm on Windows) using your Boise State username and password. It should look something like this:\n\n\n[s_benjaminpeterson.ENG401348]> ssh -Y benjaminpeterson@onyx.boisestate.edu\nbenjaminpeterson@onyx.boisestate.edu's password:\n\n\n\n\nOnce connected to Onyx there are 143 possible nodes that can be accessed. The nodes are named onyxnode01â€“onyxnode143. Your home drive is shared between all nodes. Any files you save in your home drive will be accessible on any node that you login to.\n\n\nTo check which nodes are online you can run the following command: pdsh â€“a uptime. If you get this response the node is turned off:\n\n\nmichaelekstrand@onyx ~> pdsh -a uptime\nonyxnode10: Connection closed by 192.168.10.10\npdsh@onyx: onyxnode10: ssh exited with exit code 255\n\n\n\nThe load information will also give you a hint as to how busy that node is.\n\n\n\nTo access a node type the following from the command line: ssh onyxnodexx. Replace the xx with the correct node number:\n\n\n\n\n\nmichaelekstrand@onyx ~> ssh onyxnode47\n\n\n\n\nConda on Onyx\n\nOnyx already has a copy of conda installed, but it is system-wide so you cannot use it to manage your own packages. Therefore, you should install Miniconda in your home directory and use that instead of the system-wide conda:\n\n\n\n$ wget https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh\n$ /bin/sh Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh\n\n\n\n\nNotes on Onyx Nodes\n\nYour user prompt will tell you which node you are on, in case you forget.\n\n\nBefore doing computationally-intensive tasks on a node, it is good to make sure that no one else is using it; the w command will tell you who is using the system.\n\n\nThe tmux program will let you detach from long-running processes and keep from killing them if you lose your connection.\n\n\nTo transfer files between your local computer and Onyx, use CyberDuck or MobaXtermâ€™s built-in file transfer. Since home directories are shared, you can transfer files directly to your home directory on onyx.boisestate.edu and they will be available on all nodes.\n\n\n\nAccessing Onyx Notebooks\n\nThe Onyx nodes live behind a firewall, so it is difficult to remotely access notebooks.  One useful tool for doing this is ngrok; you can find information on using it with Jupyter on Michael Ekstrandâ€™s blog.\n\n\nIn order to use ngrok, you need to do a few things:\n\n\n\n\nCreate an account on https://ngrok.io.\n\n\nIn your â€˜Authâ€™ tab, you will find a authtoken. Copy it!\n\n\nRun the following command on any Onyx node â€” just once is enough for the rest of the term:\n\n\n$ ngrok authtoken \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce that initial setup is done, you can make tunnels for your notebook servers:\n\n\n\n\nStart tmux\n\n\nStart jupyter notebook in your project directory\n\n\nSplit the terminal (Ctrl+b \")\n\n\nStart ngrok in the second terminal\n\n\nngrok http 8888\n\n\n\nYou will need to look at the jupyter notebook output to see the actual port to use.\n\n\n\nConnect to the specified HTTPS URL in your browser. It will ask you for a token; copy that from the Jupyter console output.\n\n\n\n\nSee the blog post for more details.\n\n"},"resources/git.html":{"url":"resources/git.html","title":"Git for Data Science","keywords":"","body":"Git for Data Science\n\n\n\nThis document is to help you get started using Git for data science projects.  It is not a self-contained tutorial, but aims to build on existing excellent works to help you make effective use of git.\n\n\n\n\nWhat is Git? Why?\n\n\nSerious programming and scientific endeavors usually benefit from some kind of version control: a record of past versions of the project so that you can recover old code and know exactly what version of code or analysis scripts you are working with.  Git also provides a very good way to ship code between computers, so you can move things from your local computer to a compute server.\n\n\n\n\nInstalling Git\n\n\nWe will need both git and an add-on package called git-lfs.\n\n\n\n\nOn Linux, install them from your repository:\n\n\nsudo apt-get install git git-lfs\nsudo yum install git git-lfs\n\n\n\n\nOn Mac, itâ€™s easiest to use homebrew:\n\n\nbrew install git git-lfs\n\n\n\n\nOn Windows, you can download the binary installers for both Git and Git-LFS, or you can use a package manager such as scoop.\n\n\n\n\nFor at least Windows, and likely other platforms, git and git-lfs are also available via Conda:\n\n\n\nconda install git\nconda install -c conda-forge git-lfs\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroducing Git\n\n\nThere are many, many tutorials and resources to get started with Git.  Here are a few:\n\n\n\n\nTry Git, a hands-on interactive tutorial\n\n\nGit Basics videos\n\n\nVersion Control by Example, particularly chapters 2, 4, and 8\n\n\nThe Pro Git book, if you want a more in-depth treatment\n\n\n\n\nGit has extensive built-in reference documentation, but that can be quite difficult to parse.  Run e.g. git help commit to read it.\n\n\nYou may also find the Git manpage generator entertaining.\n\n\n\n\nGUIs\n\n\nGit is primarily a command-line tool.  If you like a GUI, SourceTree works on Windows and Mac.\n\n\n\n\nDirectory Layout\n\n\nIt helps to have a planned layout for your projects. Particular tools may encourage different layouts, but I usaully use something like this:\n\n\n\n\nNotebooks go in the root directory\n\n\nInput data goes in a directory called data\n\n\nOutput files go in a directory called output (this may change depending on what other tools I use)\n\n\nSometimes I have a directory called temp for temporary or scratch files\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIgnoring Files\n\n\nWe donâ€™t want to commit everything to Git.\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\nA key rule for happy Git usage: commit inputs, not outputs.\n\n\n\n\n\nData science work will break this rule a little bit, but in general we donâ€™t want to commit our output files or temporary working files.  We want to commit analysis code and documentation, and often final analysis output, but thatâ€™s it.\n\n\nGit lets us tell it to ignore files by listing them in a file called .gitignore.  In the top-level of your project, create such a file with the following contents:\n\n\n\n# ignore Jupyter checkpoint files\n.ipynb_checkpoints\n# if you use node.js, exclude the node libraries\nnode_modules\n# excluded editor temp files\n.*.swp\n*~\n# we usually don't want log files\n*.log\n# if our outputs go in a directory 'output', exclude it too\n/output\n/temp\n\n\n\nDepending on the other tools you use, you may want to exclude additional files.\n\n\n\n\nWorking with Data\n\n\nGit works well for small files, particularly source code; it is ok for images and small binary files as well.\n\n\nHowever, it does not work as well on its own for large files, such as input data sets.  For that, we have two options:\n\n\n\n\nIgnore data in .gitignore and manage it separately (e.g. have a script that downloads and unpacks it)\n\n\nStore data in git-lfs (Large File Storage)\n\n\n\n\nEither of these works, and which one we should use depends on the project and our available resources (BitBucket provides 1GB of large file storage for free, which may not be enough if you have a lot of projects).\n\n\nUsing git-lfs\n\nTo use git-lfs, you need to first install the software, and then set it up for your repository:\n\n\n\ngit lfs install\n\n\n\nThen we track files with git-lfs prior to adding them:\n\n\n\ngit lfs track 'data/*.csv'\n\n\n\nThen we can add the files:\n\n\n\ngit add data/*.csv\n\n\n\nAnd see that theyâ€™re added to LFS:\n\n\n\ngit lfs ls-files\n\n\n\nAnd finally commit:\n\n\n\ngit commit\n\n\n\nWhen we git push, it will push the LFS files separately to the LFS store.\n\n\n\n"},"resources/good-notebooks.html":{"url":"resources/good-notebooks.html","title":"Writing Good Notebooks","keywords":"","body":"Writing Good Notebooks\n\n\n\nWriting good Jupyter notebooks is something of an art; this page is to give you some ideas and general guidelines to make your notebooks more readable.\n\n\n\n\nWrite to be Read\n\n\n\nLet us change our traditional attitude to the construction of programs: Instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a computer what to do, let us concentrate rather on explaining to human beings what we want a computer to do.\n\n\nâ€” Donald Knuth\n\n\n\nA good Jupyter notebook is, first and foremost, a document to be read by humans.  It contains code and outputs, but those are for the purpose of providing information to the reader.  Everything in a good notebook must serve the purpose of communicating, or be a subsidiary point to communicating.\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\nRule 1: Can another person read this and understand (1) what I am trying to do, (2) what I conclude, and (3) why my conclusions are supported by the data?\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are three key components of this:\n\n\n\n\nClear, understandable code that is free of needless clutter.  The reader needs to be able to check that you are actually computing what you claim to be computing.\n\n\nClear writing that explains the question, the method, and illuminates the results.\n\n\nAn understanding of your audience.\n\n\n\n\nThere are some things about Jupyter that make overall readability a bit challenging; in particular, there isnâ€™t a good way to define functions and routines elsewhere (unless you just write an R script), so the top part of a notebook is often full of preliminaries that set up for the real substance of the notebook.\n\n\nOn the last point â€” audience â€” for this class, you can assume that your audience understands the material we have covered in class and in the readings.  So you do not need to explain, for example, how a linear regression works.  You do need to explain why you chose the features and transformations that you did.  You need to explain what the results mean in terms of your problem.\n\n\n\n\nPay Attention to Flow\n\n\nA good notebook has a clear, logical flow.  Part of this is determined by the natural flow of data processing:\n\n\n\n\nLoad libraries\n\n\nLoad data\n\n\nPre-process data so it is useful for analysis\n\n\nPresent basic data descriptions (distributions, summary statistics, data sizes)\n\n\nCarry out and interpret the main analysis\n\n\n\n\nWithin individual parts of a document, however, flow also matters.  There are different ways to approach it; what I like to do in most notebooks is the following:\n\n\n\n\nExplain what I am going to do and why\n\n\nDo it (code)\n\n\nInterpret results\n\n\n\n\nI donâ€™t like to put the results before the code; it breaks the top-down flow of the narrative.\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\nRule 2: Does my document read from the top down, with each piece building only on things that came before?\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is also good to make individual questions or arguments compact, so that the reader doesnâ€™t lose the flow while reading.  Rather than laying out several questions, then computing, then explaining answers, answer the questions one at a time. Otherwise, in the middle of a lot of code, the reader can forget what the point was.\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\nRule 3: Are my questions and arguments compact?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPay Attention to Code Flow\n\n\nThis rule is easier to check: at all times, you should be able to re-run your notebook from top to bottom and get the correct results.\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\nRule 4: Does my document run correctly from top-to-bottom?\n\n\n\n\n\nCode blocks cannot depend on variables defined later in the document.\n\n\nThe correctness cannot depend on which of three different code blocks you ran â€” store the results of code variants in different variables.\n\n\nThis is important for reproducibility: enabling someone else to rerun and reuse your results.\n\n\nIt is also good to put code with the question that it is answering.  This sometimes competes with code reuse, but keeping code with its questions makes it easier to verify that the answer to that question is correct.\n\n\nIt is also crucial to route data through variables as much as possible; avoid copying and pasting data.  This improves reproducibility, because you donâ€™t need to take manual steps to make the notebook correct.\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\nRule 5: Can my document re-run and produce correct results without human intervention?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAvoid Extraneous Code and Output\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\nRule 6: Does all code and output advance the narrative?\n\n\n\n\n\nUnnecessary code and output makes it more difficult to see the central point of the notebook.  It is common to put in additional code and outputs for debugging, but before submitting or publishing a notebook you should either remove such outputs or weave them into the narrative.  The latter is often possible; if you argue for why the output helps you understand the correctness of the preceeding or following code, it can strengthen the document.\n\n\nThis doesnâ€™t mean omit all output that isnâ€™t directly used to answer a question. When I compute a new object, I often dump a quick head or summary, just so that the reader can see the output of the code we just ran and better understand it.\n\n\nItâ€™s easier to read if you stick to one output per code block.\n\n\nAlso, break up blocks of code with explanatory text.  Why are you doing what you are doing?\n\n\n\n\nExamples\n\n\n\n\nRat Tumors â€” this notebook works through an example from Chapter 5 of Bayesian Data Analysis, 3rd Edition, by Gelman et al.

I may add a few questions, but will do so no later than Sep. 15.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Set\n\n\nFor this project, you will use the Last.FM data from HetRec 2011.  This data set consists of several tab-separated value files, each of which has a different set of records:\n\n\n\nartists.dat\n\nInformation about music artists.\n\ntags.dat\n\nInformation about tags (mapping from tag IDs to tags).\n\nuser_artists.dat\n\nThe number of times each user has listened to each artist.\n\nuser_taggedartists.dat\n\nTags users have applied to artists; this file uses IDs, so you will need to join with the other files to make it readable.\n\n\n\n\nYou can read each of these files with the read_tsv() function from readr.\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\n\n\nCreate a new Git repository, both locally and on BitBucket (your BitBucket repository should be private), to store your work.\n\n\nUnpack the files into the data directory, and add them with git lfs:\n\n\n\ngit lfs track '*.dat'\ngit add data\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nFor this project, you will share your Git repository with me to submit it, and I need to be able to re-run your notebook.\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a Jupyter notebook to contain your data analysis.\n\n\nDo not commit the HTML export of your notebook.\n\n\n\n\nNecessary Functions\n\n\nFor this assignment, youâ€™ll need quite a few dplyr functions:\n\n\n\n\ninner_join to merge tables\n\n\ngroup_by and summarize to aggregate data\n\n\narrange to sort data\n\n\n\n\nAnd probably some more!  Weâ€™ll be working some examples in class to help with this.\n\n\nFor example, to count the number of users playing each artist and the number of times the artist has been played, you can write:\n\n\n\nartists = read_tsv('artists.dat')\nplays = read_tsv('user_artists.dat')\nplays %>%\n    group_by(artistID) %>%\n    summarize(userCount=n(),\n              totalPlays=sum(weight)) %>%\n    inner_join(select(artists, artistID=id, name=name))\n\n\n\nThink about what this code does a bit â€” I think you will find it instructive in how to put together dplyr pipelines.\n\n\n\n\nExploring the Data\n\n\nAnswer the following questions:\n\n\n\n\nPlot the distribution of play counts per artist\n\n\nPlot the distribution of unique users playing each artist\n\n\nPlot the distribution of play counts per user\n\n\nPlot the distribution of unique artists per user\n\n\nWhat is the mean artists-per-user? Users-per-artist? Plays per user/artist pair?\n\n\nWhat are the 10 artists with the most plays?\n\n\nWhat are the 10 artists with the most unique playing users?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssociation Rules\n\n\nOne common problem in sales and media is identifying related products: if a user likes Nickelback, what other artists might we be able to recommend?\n\n\nOne way to do this is through association rules: look at other artists listened to by users who like Nickelback.  We can think of a very simple association rule as a conditional probability.  If we denote by \\(A_u\\) the set of artists played by user \\(u\\), we can compute the association between artists \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) by:\n\n\n\n\\[P(b \\in A_u | a \\in A_u)\\]\n\n\n\nYou will probably find it useful to make use of the identity \\(P(X|Y) = P(X,Y)/P(Y)\\).  We can estimate \\(P(X,Y)\\) from co-plays, the number of users who have listened to both artists in a pair.\n\n\nQUESTION: What is the most commonly-played pair of artists?\n\n\nEstimating the joint probabilities can be tricky. A naive solution to compute the joint probabilities between all pairs of items is \\(O(n^2)\\) probability computations.\n\n\nWe can take advantage of the fact that two artists that never appear together have a co-play count of 0, and that the artists.dat table links artists to plays.\n\n\n\ncoplays = plays %>%\n    select(a1=artistID, userID) %>%\n    inner_join(select(plays, a2=artistID, userID)) %>%\n    filter(a1 != a2) %>%\n    group_by(a1, a2) %>%\n    summarize(count = n())\n\n\n\nNow that we have our coplay counts, you can answer the following:\n\n\n\n\nWhat pair of artists has been co-played the most often?\n\n\nHow many users have listened to both Nickelback and Britney Spears?\n\n\nWhat is the probability that a randomly-selected user has listened to both Nickelback and Britney Spears?\n\n\nGiven that a user has listened to Nickelback, what is the probability that they have also listened to Britney Spears?\n\n\nGiven that a user has listened to Aretha Franklin, what 10 artists are they most likely to have listened to?\n\n\n\n\nExtending Association Rules\n\nNaive association rules have the problem that they tend to favor popular items.  For a popular artist such as Katy Perry, many people listen to her no matter what else they listen to; \\(P(\\textrm{katy perry}|X)\\) is high no matter what \\(X\\) is.  (Except that Katy Perry isnâ€™t in our data set because itâ€™s old.)\n\n\nWhat we can do instead is measure lift, which measures how positively coupled two items are by measuring how much more likely the user is to listen to both of them than they would be if the two items were completely independent.\n\n\n\n\\[\\textrm{lift(X,Y)} = \\frac{P(X,Y)}{P(X)P(Y)}\\]\n\n\n\nThere are other formulas we can use as well, but this one will get us started.\n\n\n\n\nWhat 10 artists have the highest lift with respect to Aretha Franklin?\n\n\nWhat is the lift of Nickelback and Britney Spears?\n\n\nWhat is the lift of Britney Spears and Ozzy Ozborne?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmitting\n\n\n\n\nPush your notebook & data to a repository on your BitBucket account\n\n\nGive my user (mdekstrand) read access to your repository\n\n\nSend me an e-mail with a link to your repository\n\n\n\n\nThe assignment is due on Monday, Sep. 25 by midnight.\n\n\n"},"assignments/assignment3.html":{"url":"assignments/assignment3.html","title":"Assignment 3","keywords":"","body":"Assignment 3\n\n\n\nThis assignment is due on Oct. 16 at 11:59 p.m..\n\n\nFor this assignment, you will again e-mail me an HTML export of a notebook.\n\n\n\n\nRevisions\n\n\n\n\n\nOct. 8\n\n\nClarified discrimination protected class\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContext\n\n\nFor this assignment, you will use logistic regression (a variant of linear regression) to build a credit-scoring model.  This project consists of several parts:\n\n\n\n\nImport and explore the data\n\n\nBuild a credit model using a logsistic regression\n\n\nEvaluate the accuracy of the credit model\n\n\nEvaluate whether the credit model results in unwanted discrimination\n\n\nReflect on the limitations of the provided data\n\n\n\n\nI expect that your notebook will likely follow the same structure as this document.\n\n\n\n\nThe Data\n\n\nYouâ€™ll work with the German Credit Data data set.  You can download it from that site by clicking the â€˜Data Folderâ€™ link.\n\n\nThe data is space-delimited; read it with:\n\n\n\ncredit_raw = read_delim(\"german.data.txt\", delim=\" \",\n                        col_names=c(â€¦))\n\n\n\nIn the c(â€¦) for col_names, provide strings that name each of the columns.  There are 21 columns; the first 20 columns are the data attributes described on the data set page, and the 21st is the outcome column. An outcome of 1 means the loan was a good credit risk, and an ouctome of 2 means it was a bad credit risk.\n\n\nData Types\n\nYou will need to process the data into meaningful types. By default, read_csv will read characters, integers, and numeric values.  However, you will want to make some conversions.\n\n\n\nLogical\n\nColumns representing a boolean value should be represented as a logical column, storing TRUE and FALSE values.  For example, you can convert the outcome field to a logical GoodRisk field by writing:\n\n\ncredit_raw %>% mutate(GoodRisk = outcome == 1)\n\n\n\nFactor\n\nCategorical data, such as the type of job, should be represented as an R factor. The factor and as.factor functions let you convert character vectors to factor vectors.\n\nOrdered Factor\n\nSome columns, such as the employment status, may make most sense as ordered factors: they are categorical, but one level is less than the next.  The ordered=TRUE parameter to as.factor can accomplish this.\n\n\n\n\n\nPreparing for Evaluation\n\nSo your machine learning process doesnâ€™t cheat, split the data into training and testing data right away.  Use 10% of the data for testing.  The sample_n function can sample a data frame.\n\n\n\nExploring the Data\n\nProduce appropriate plots, tables, and text to understand the distribution of the various attributes and the outcome variable, and to look at potential relationships.\n\n\nYou may find bar charts, histograms, and box plots useful. It is unlikely that you will find scatter plots very useful for this particular problem, since the outcome variable is logical.\n\n\n\n\n\nBuild Models\n\n\nBuild a logistic regression to predict whether a borrower is a good credit risk.\n\n\nLogistic regressions use the glm function, which works very much like lm:\n\n\n\nmodel = glm(outcome ~ pred1 + pred2 + pred3*pred4, data=data,\n            family=binomial())\n\n\n\nThe family option tells glm to predict binomial (logical) outcomes, and will do so with a logistic regression by default.  The regression output (predictions) are numeric scores; you can convert them into binary outcomes by setting a threshold, and accepting any prediction over the threshold as TRUE.\n\n\nFind the best model that you can!  The stepAIC function may be useful in automating some of the feature selection, but you want to put some thought into feature selection as well.\n\n\nPresent your model code, show the results of fitting different models, and describe the features you select in your final model.  Consider interaction features (f1 * f2*) that you think might be relevant.\n\n\nIf you want to split your training data into train and tune data to do your feature selection based on classification accuracy, that is fine! But before next step, you should train your final model over the whole set of training data.\n\n\n\n\nEvaluate Model Effectiveness\n\n\nOnce you have 1â€”3 models that you like, evaluate their effectiveness on the test data you withheld at the beginning of the project.\n\n\nReport the following:\n\n\n\n\nAn ROC curve.  The plotROC package is very useful for drawing these.\n\n\nThe cost, as defined by the data set provider; a false positive (classifying a bad credit risk as good) has a cost of 5, and a false negative (classifying a good credit risk as bad) has a cost of 1.  Plot the cost as a function of the threshold (the threshold on the x axis, and the cost over the test data at that threshold on the y axis).\n\n\nThe threshold that produces minimal cost.\n\n\nFor that threshold and 2 others, the precision and recall.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvaluate Discrimination\n\n\nDiscrimination is an important consideration in credit decisions.  Many groups have been or still are subject to unjust discrimination; in the U.S., women and racial minorities have historically been denied credit when a others with a similar economic condition would receive credit.  Credit scoring can improve this situation, and indeed has improved the ability of racial minorities to obtain credit in the United States.  But this is not automatic â€” we must test our models for discrimination.\n\n\nFor our purposes, we will consider 2 groups of borrowsers as at-risk for discrimination:\n\n\n\n\nNon-single women (as opposed to men)\n\n\nForeign workers\n\n\n\n\nDirect Discrimination\n\nThe first kind of discrimination is direct discrimination: does the model use one of these features directly?\n\n\nExamine your model and see whether directly discriminates on the basis of either of these features. Write what you find.\n\n\n\nIndirect Discrimination\n\nThe second kind of discrimination is indirect: where the protected characteristic is not directly used, but correlates with other features that are used.  In the United States, some forms of indirect discrimination are illegal.\n\n\nIndirect discrimination can be tricky to detect.  One useful step is to look for correlations between the protected characteristic and the features used in your model.  Generate plots that show these relationships.\n\n\nAnother useful way to detect indirect discrimination is to generate a second model that attempts to predict the main modelâ€™s output using the protected characteristic(s).  You can train a logistic regression that predicts the main modelâ€™s decisions, or you can train a linear regression that predicts the main modelâ€™s scores.  If you can effectively predict a significant portion of the main modelâ€™s results, that is evidence that the model may be indirectly discriminatory.  You can also attempt to predict the main modelâ€™s errors using the protected characteristics.\n\n\nTry all three of these methods.\n\n\nDoes it look like your model is indirectly discriminatory against members of our protected classes? Why or why not?\n\n\nDoes changing the cost weights (from the evaluation section), for example decreasing the cost of a false positive, result in a more or less discriminatory model?\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThere is far more to discrimination detection and removal than we have time to get to in this assignment, and much of it requires more sophisticated statistical methods than we have yet covered. This assignment hopefully gives you a starting point, though.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLimitations\n\n\nAs we have discussed, our data is always limited, possibly in important ways.  Write 2â€“5 paragraphs about the limitations of the data, supported with plots if you think they would be helpful, and the impact these limitations have on your model and evaluation.  Some points to consider:\n\n\n\n\nIs the ground truth accurate? What does that mean for modeling?\n\n\nIf the data arises from an historically-discriminatory process, what does that mean for the model? What does that mean for our attempts to measure discrimination?\n\n\nWhat are some limitations of our attempts to detect unjust, illegal, or unwanted discrimination?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrading\n\n\nWithin each category, your grade will be based on three things:\n\n\n\n\nReasonableness and justification of attempts (e.g. do you have appropriate plot types, do you have good justifications for your choice of plots, variables, and models, etc.) [25%]\n\n\nCorrectness of code, results, and inferences [40%]\n\n\nPresentation of motivations, results, and conclusions [15%]\n\n\nUsing good coding practices as we have discussed in class and readings [10%]\n\n\n\n\nDo note that there can be some interaction between these â€” poor presentation can mean that I do not follow your justification or inference, and therefore cannot judge its correctness or validity.\n\n\nI will weight the categories as follows:\n\n\n\n\n10% setup and data loading\n\n\n15% data exploration\n\n\n25% modeling\n\n\n30% evaluation\n\n\n15% discrimination analysis\n\n\n5% discussion of limitations\n\n\n\n\n"},"assignments/assignment4.html":{"url":"assignments/assignment4.html","title":"Assignment 4","keywords":"","body":"Assignment 4\n\n\n\nDue on Nov. 1, 2017 at 11:59 PM.\n\n\n\n\nRevisions\n\n\n\nOct. 30, 2017\n\n\n\n\nCorrected FPR and FNR definitions (Wikipedia is correct)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReadings\n\n\n\n\nProPublica article\n\n\nProPublica technical description\n\n\nNorthpointe Rebuttal\n\n\nProPublica Response\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\n\n\nDownload the compas-scores-two-years.csv file from the ProPublica analysis data.

The data I am providing is taken from the JSTOR Early Journal Collection, and is in the public domain in the United States.  You can download the whole EJC archive if you would like more data to play with.\n\n\nI am providing the data in an SQLite database instead of a CSV file, because it works better with large text. You do not need to know any SQL for this assignment: with the dbplyr package, dplyr can read directly from the database (and dplyr verbs get translated directly to SQL, so as much computation as possible happens directly in the database engine).\n\n\n\n\nRevision Log\n\n\n\nNov. 14, 2017\n\n\n\n\nFixed spread calls in examples\n\n\nUpdated due date\n\n\nFixed rubric\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrerequisites\n\n\n\n\nThe tidytext package (Conda r-tidytext)\n\n\nThe rsqlite and dbplyr packages (Conda r-rsqlite, r-dbplyr)\n\n\nThe data file\n\n\n\n\nUnzip the data file. The unzipped file will take approximately 1.1 GB on disk.\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThis assignment works with a much larger data set than previous assignments.  It will probably require more than 4GB of memory by the time you are done.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\n\n\nLoad your standard libraries, and in addition the tidytext and dbplyr libraries.\n\n\nTo access the database, create a database connection:\n\n\n\ndb = src_sqlite('ejc-trimmed.db')\n\n\n\nThis database contains two tables: journals lists the journals (by ID and an abbreviated code), and articles has the articles themselves (the journal field of this table contains the title of the journal as it appeared when the article was published).\n\n\nTo access a specific table, use the tbl verb:\n\n\n\narticles = db %>% tbl('articles')\njournals = db %>% tbl('journals')\n\n\n\nAfter these assignments, articles and journals will be R tbl objects; theyâ€™re like data frames, except they havenâ€™t been loaded into memory yet. You can use the normal dplyr verbs like select, filter, group_by, summarize, etc. on them.\n\n\nThe collect verb will slurp put a table into memory as a data frame; this is useful at the end of several dplyr operations.  The head function also works, and is a good way to see what the tables look like and get a feel for your column names:\n\n\n\nhead(articles)\n\n\n\nYouâ€™ll need to use tidytext tokenization in order to split article text (the text column) into words that we can analyze; tidytext requires that we first load data into memory.  For example, the following will get all articles from the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society published in 1700, and tokenize them:\n\n\n\nroyal_1700_tokens = db_out %>% tbl('journals') %>%\n    filter(name == 'RoyalPhil') %>%\n    inner_join(db_out %>% tbl('articles')) %>%\n    filter(year == 1700) %>%\n    select(doi, title, pub_date, text) %>%\n    collect() %>%  # pull the data into memory so we can use it\n    unnest_tokens(word, text)\n\n\n\nIf youâ€™re curious, you can see the SQL query:\n\n\n\ndb_out %>% tbl('journals') %>%\n    filter(name == 'RoyalPhil') %>%\n    inner_join(db_out %>% tbl('articles')) %>%\n    filter(year == 1700) %>%\n    select(doi, title, pub_date, text) %>%\n    show_query()\n\n\n\nItâ€™s kinda messy, but it works.\n\n\n\n\nPreliminary Exploration\n\n\n\n\nPlot a use-by-rank distribution of the words used in the corpus, separately for each journal.  You should see a Ziph distribution, like in Text Mining.\n\n\nShow the 10 most common words in each journal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWord Distributions\n\n\nThe main objective of this assignment is to examine the change in language use over time (looking year-over-year).\n\n\nThere are three high-level research questions.  You should answer these separately for each journal, and over the enitre corpus; and you should consider them both for article text, and for just article titles (word use in article titles is interesting!).\n\n\n\n\nWhat 5â€“10 words see the greatest increase in use over time?\n\n\nWhat 5â€“10 words see the greatest decrease in use over time?\n\n\nWhat 5â€“10 words are the most consistently frequently used?\n\n\n\n\nFor these, you need to think about and appropriate way to measure and normalize in order to answer the question appropriately.  Describe and justify your decisions in your notebook.\n\n\nYour analysis should include one or more plots for each journal that shows words and their change in use over time (the x-axis should be year, the y-axis your metric of use, and a different-colored line for each word).\n\n\n\n\nText Similarity\n\n\nIt can be fun to compare text for its similarity.  One way to do this is with term frequency: how frequently a word appears in a document or group of documents.  The term frequence for a term t in a document D is the number of times t appears divided by the total number of terms in D.  We usually remove stop words prior to computing TF vectors.\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nA TF vector for a single 'document' is a probability distribution!  Specifically, it is the probability of getting a particular word if you randomly select a word from the document.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have a data frame journal_word_counts that has the number of times each word appears in each journal, you can compute the TF with:\n\n\n\njournal_tf = journal_word_counts %>%\n    group_by(jnl_id) %>%\n    mutate(tf = count / sum(count))\n\n\n\nThis treats each journal as a single document, and computes its term frequencies; you can also consider individual articles.\n\n\nYou can then spread the TF to get a data frame whose columns are the term frequencies in each journal:\n\n\n\nterm_freqs = journal_tf %>%\n    inner_join(journals) %>%\n    select(name, word, tf) %>%\n    spread(name, tf, fill=0)\n\n\n\nWe can then compute a correlations between two journals' term vectors with cor, or the whole set with:\n\n\n\nterm_freqs %>% select(-word) %>% cor()\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat two journals are the most similar? Which two are the least similar?\n\n\n\n\nDivergence Over Time\n\nFrom the late 1700s until the 1860s, we have data for both the American philosophical transactions ('AmPhil') and the British Royal Society philosophical transactions ('RoyalPhil').  Further, it seems plausible to expect that the American writings would stat out similar to British, and then diverge as American culture diverged from British.  Letâ€™s look at the deviation over time using the K-L divergence, a measurement of how much one probability distribution deviates from another.\n\n\nThe K-L divergence between two probability distributions \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) is defined as follows:\n\n\n\n\\[D(P|Q) = - \\sum_t P(t) \\mathrm{log}_2 \\frac{Q(i)}{P(i)}\\]\n\n\n\nThis metric is asymmetric: it measures how much \\(P\\) deviates from \\(Q\\), which is not necessarily the same as the other way around.  Use the Royal Society term frequencies as the base distribution \\(Q\\), and American as \\(P\\). One way to think of this is that we are measuring how unexpected the langauge in American articles would be to someone familiar with British articles; a K-L divergence of 0 is no surprise, and larger divergences are completely alien.\n\n\nThere is one last little trick needed for the K-L divergence: it doesnâ€™t behave well when there are zero probabilities, but the TF is zero for every word that never appears in a document.  The way to fix this is to modify the TF formula so that instead of computing \\(n_t / \\sum_t n_t\\), we compute \\(\\frac{n_t + 1}{(\\sum_t n_t) + |T|}\\), where \\(|T|\\) is the number of different terms in our set of texts.  This will be easiest to implement if you write a text_divergence function that takes two vectors of counts, not vectors of term frequencies, and computes the K-L divergence between their frequencies.\n\n\nThen you can do something like this:\n\n\n\nsim_over_time = journal_year_word_counts %>%\n    group_by(name, year, word) %>%\n    summarize(count = n()) %>%\n    spread(name, count, fill=0) %>%\n    group_by(year) %>%\n    summarize(divergence = text_divergence(AmPhil, RoyalPhil))\n\n\n\nThen plot the divergence over time!\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nPonder: why is this trick for fixing K-L divergence a reasonable thing to do?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExtra Credit: Computer Science Titles\n\n\nFor 10% extra credit (on this assignmentâ€™s grade), download the DBLP data set and look at the three word distribution research questions in the titles of computer science research papers.\n\n\n\n\nGrading\n\n\nWithin each category, your grade will be based on three things:\n\n\n\n\nReasonableness and justification of attempts (e.g. do you have appropriate plot types, do you have good justifications for your choice of plots, variables, and measurements, etc.) [25%]\n\n\nCorrectness of code, results, and inferences [45%]\n\n\nPresentation of motivations, results, and conclusions [15%]\n\n\nUsing good coding practices as we have discussed in class and readings [5%]\n\n\n\n\nDo note that there can be some interaction between these â€” poor presentation can mean that I do not follow your justification or inference, and therefore cannot judge its correctness or validity.\n\n\nI will weight the categories as follows:\n\n\n\n\n10% setup and data loading\n\n\n20% preliminary exploration\n\n\n50% word distributions\n\n\n15% journal similarities\n\n\n5% Am/Brit similarity over time\n\n\n\n\n"},"assignments/assignment67.html":{"url":"assignments/assignment67.html","title":"Assignments 6&7","keywords":"","body":"Assignment 6/7\n\n\n\nPart 1 (A6) is due November 27, 2017 at 11:59 PM.
