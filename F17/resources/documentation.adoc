= Documentation

The book http://r4ds.had.co.nz/[R for Data Science] will be our main starting point for documentation, in addition to the function documentation built in to R. However, we will be using Jupyter instead of RStudio.

R and many libraries also have online manuals:

* https://cran.r-project.org/manuals.html[Core R Manuals]
* http://dplyr.tidyverse.org/[dplyr]
* http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/[ggplot2]
* http://readr.tidyverse.org/[readr]

== Further Reading

* If you want to read more about Bayesian statistics, I recommend Peter Hoff's http://boisestate.worldcat.org/oclc/432708578[A First Course in Bayesian Statistical Methods].
