= Week 5

This week, we're going to try what has been suggsted: a more lecture-style class on Monday, and a full team application class on Wednesday.

I'd still like to use the team classroom layout on Monday, to give some flexibility for the lecture to be active and to incorporate a readiness test.

== Pre-Class Reading

To be read before Monday's class.
