= Week 2 (Aug. 28 â€” Sep 1)

== Resources Useful for Assignment 1

* The http://r4ds.had.co.nz/[R for Data Science] book, particularly http://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html[Chapter 5].
* The http://dplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/dplyr.html[dplyr introduction]

IMPORTANT: Use `dplyr` verbs. Many R tutorials you will find on the Internet will teach you old ways of working with R, which are much more error-prone and difficult to read. I have tried to select R resources that start you out with `dplyr` and the rest of the `tidyverse` right away, because they make R code so much easier to read and write.
